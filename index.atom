    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orge9ac0b0" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orge9ac0b0"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9ac0b0"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like to listen to music at work. Sometimes I just stream from
YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify or some other online source but if you're
a person of a certain age, like me, you probably have quite an mp3
collection. All those CDs that have been ripped not to mention some
converted vinyl.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I used to use the &lt;a href="https://www.musicpd.org/"&gt;Music Player Daemon&lt;/a&gt; or MPD back in the day. It would
run in the background and you could connect to it using lots of
&lt;a href="https://www.musicpd.org/clients/"&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I was running Ubuntu and Mint Linux, I had some trouble setting
up MPD but the process is much smoother using Manjaro which is Arch
based and I'm currently enjoying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a video on how I set up MPD and also use Emacs to control it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coincidentally, on the same day I recorded this, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDEtZ7AKmwS0_GNJog01D2g/feed"&gt;Uncle Dave&lt;/a&gt; put up a
similar &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVN8UDScqk"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Dave also sets up MPD on an Arch based linux but he
uses EMMS for his player. I ultimately end up with Simple-MPC with
briefs stops at the built in MPC mode and Mingus along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8b3311b"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With CS4All being the buzzword of the day we're paying a lot of
attention to the fact that when we teach a CS class for all students,
most of them won't end up studying CS or going directly
into a tech heavy field. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Among those that do study CS though, there is another division. Those
studying CS as an academic exercise or to go on to graduate studies
and those who are going in to the tech sector. For those going into
the tech field, it's important that they're prepared in terms of
software development, design, and all those goodies not covered in CS
classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not advocating removing the good stuff currently in most colleg CS
curricua, although I will say that most CS programs I've reveiwed could benefit by
trimming some requriements and adding some electives. I am advocating
doing more than telling your students "comment your code," - a refrain
many undergrads have heard frequently with little guidance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm advocating to begin by bringing in tools and practices that either
don't detract from current CS classes or in fact can add to or
streamline them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year I wrote about &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/"&gt;using Git and GitHub&lt;/a&gt; in my classes. Students
have to submit projects anyway and frequently have to work in teams so
using Git and a Git hosting service can actually make both student's
and instructor's class experiences better while introducing them to an
industry best practice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today I want to talk about testing. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students are always told to test their code but frequently not given
tremendous guidance. The results can be:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projects that don't compile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projects that compile and run but not the way they're supposed to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wonky input or interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projects that don't work for all cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
On the instructor side, we have to evaluate the student's
submissions and deal with all of this. Some teachers use auto graders
to help. I have mixed feelings on them. On the one hand they can speed
up grading but on the other hand it's important for me as the teacher
to actually dive into the student's code. In any case, using an auto grader
is actually somewhat similar to running a test suite.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why not have the students create their own test suites? If done right,
this should encourage students to evaluate their own code more
carefully and also cut down on the time it takes the intructor to
evaluate a given submission. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This means that we have to use a testing framework with a very low
cost of entry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I ended up finding &lt;a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest"&gt;doctest&lt;/a&gt; for C++. It's really simple and just a
single include file. This means that students don't have to actually
install anything on their machines. Here's the example from the
project page:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/raw/master/scripts/data/using_doctest_888px_wide.gif" alt="using_doctest_888px_wide.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically, the students can just start writing tests.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Python also has a couple of low friction testing options. One is to
use the built in &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html"&gt;doctest&lt;/a&gt; facility. Basically you put sample runs in the doc
string at the top of a function with the expected output:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""Return the factorial of n, an exact integer &amp;gt;= 0.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    If the result is small enough to fit in an int, return an int.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Else return a long.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; factorial(30)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    265252859812191058636308480000000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;     """&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"n must be &amp;gt;= 0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"n must be exact integer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# catch a value like 1e300&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;OverflowError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"n too large"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;factor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factor&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;factor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;doctest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;doctest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;testmod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This might seem a little cumbersome, particularly if you look at the
example at the link. It also requires the tests go on top of each
function and that the tests will print out as part of the docstring. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other easy Python option is the built in &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"&gt;unittest&lt;/a&gt; module. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's an example of testing strings from the link above:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestStringMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'FOO'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_isupper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'FOO'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isupper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertFalse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isupper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hello world'&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hello'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# check that s.split fails when the separator is not a string&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertRaises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'__main__'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I havn't played with Java testing in years but I'd guess there's
something similarly light weight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow I'm hoping to finish the groundwork on using C++ doctest with
my class and I'll write another post afterwards. Probably after SIGCSE
since I'll be attending that from Wednesday on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We'll see how this goes but I'm guessing it will work well. If it
does, it should make my life as a grader easier and also get the kids
on track to using test frameworks - something they'll need wherever
they end up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One day I'll do a Magit video but since there are already some good
ones out there I thought I'd share a couple of other great git related
packages.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first is &lt;a href="https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter/tree/00c05264af046b5ce248e5b0bc42f117d9c27a09"&gt;Git Gutter&lt;/a&gt; which adds markers on the side gutter of your
buffer so you know what's changed since you're last commit. I pretty
much use it exclusively for that visual but it can also be used to
cmmit and revert individual chunks of your changes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second is &lt;a href="https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine"&gt;Git Timemachine&lt;/a&gt; which lets you move forward and back
between commits. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The video demos both. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0bcccc1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another Emacs quick hit today. Actually, not really Emacs. Today's
video is a quick, really quick, look at &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. Pandoc is a document
converter. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are the formats that Pandoc can covert read from:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored Markdown,
MultiMarkdown, and (subsets of) Textile, reStructuredText, HTML,
LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0,
Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org mode, DocBook, JATS, Muse, txt2tags,
Vimwiki, EPUB, ODT, and Word docx.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And here are the ones it can write to:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
plain text, Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored
Markdown, MultiMarkdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML5, LaTeX
(including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, OPML, DocBook, JATS,
OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki
markup, ZimWiki markup, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 or v3), FictionBook2,
Textile, groff man, groff ms, Emacs Org mode, AsciiDoc, InDesign ICML,
TEI Simple, Muse, PowerPoint slide shows and Slidy, Slideous,
DZSlides, reveal.js, PDF
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
That's pretty impressive
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was faced with an html file describing a lab for all the CSCI13500
students at Hunter. I wanted to modify it for my class and that was
going to be a bear. I also wanted an easy way to have it render up on
GitHub. With pandoc, it was trivial. I just typed:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pandoc -f html -t org -o lab3.org lab3.html
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
which converted the file to org-mode. This was trivial to edit and
then I uploaded it to GitHub as the lab's Readme.org file which GitHub
automatically renders on the project page.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pandoc for the win.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've also used pandoc to move between org-mode and word files. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't checked out pandoc, you should.

    <title>Google Sheets</title>

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ac0ea1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I make regular use of Google's office suite. I use Google forms all
the time to collect data, Google docs when I have to leave Emacs for
document preparation - usually when I have to collaborate with others
online and I use Google Sheets as my greadebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't do a lot of data processing using Google sheets. For that I
download the data and write small scripts. On the other hand it turns
out that you can do some pretty nifty things by scripting right in
Google sheets. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Google sheets can be scripted using Javascript and Google's APIs. For
example, adding "hello" and "world" to the two bottom leftmost cells
in your active spreadsheet can be done by running a function like
this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;function addHello() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  ss.appendRow(['hello','world']);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In general, it's pretty easy to grab, modify, or otherwise manipulate
cells from a spreadsheet with simple javascript.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can also send email from a Google app script. For me this was a
big win. I use it for emailing grades to students and also as a poor
man's mailmerge. The key call is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GmailApp.sendEmail(email , subject,msg);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a video walking through sending emails to a list of people from
a spreadsheet. The code is underneath.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvQC1N9JMs0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  GmailApp.sendEmail(to,subject,msg)
}


function getSheetByName(name){
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var sheets = ss.getSheets();
  for( var n in sheets){
    if (name==sheets[n].getName()){
     return sheets[n]; 
    }
  }
    return sheets[0];
}

function prepareMessage(name){
  var sheet = getSheetByName("Msg");
  var oldSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet()
  SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet)

  var dataRange = sheet.getRange(1,1,1,1)
  data = dataRange.getValues()
  var msg = data[0][0]
  msg = msg.replace("%FIRST%",name)
  SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(oldSheet)
  return msg
}

  var cols = sheet.getLastColumn()

  var data = dataRange.getValues();
  for (i in data){
    var name = data[i][0]
    var to = data[i][1]
    var msg = prepareMessage(name)
    sendEmail(to,"Important Grade Info",msg)

    <title>Using Emacs 40 - Atomic Chrome</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to everyone who voted for topics or commented with suggestions
for videos. I'll try to get to them in the coming months.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today is just a quick hit on Atomic Chrome - an Emacs package and
browser extension that allows you to edit web form inputs with Emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgde9309d" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgde9309d"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgde9309d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I forgot to mention that you can set a shortcut key, at least in chrome rather than
clicking on the icon. This makes things much smoother.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All you have to do is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;chrome://extensions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the bottom of the page you'll see a button to set &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;keyboard shortcuts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the shortcut for Atomic Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy:

    <title>On Textbooks</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/textbooks/</id>
    <updated>2018-01-27T14:28:44-04:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orgd62a4e7" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgd62a4e7"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd62a4e7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thought I'd answer Alfred Thompson's recent post on &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/01/thinking-about-cs-textbooks.html"&gt;using
textbooks&lt;/a&gt;. Like Alfred, I've never used textbooks particularly
effectively. Even when I taught math I mostly used them as a resource
for problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also agree with Alfred in questioning the "flipped class" model or
as I like to call it "homework" for reasons similar to Alfred's. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even back in the Pascal days of APCS getting textbooks was an ordeal
in NYC. First, the book had to cover both the A and AB parts of the
class since I rarely had budget to buy two books for a class, then
they had to be sold by the high school division of the publishing
house eliminating many college texts and finally we had to get the
books on the "NYSTL list" so we could buy and pay for them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I finally found a book I liked that covered the full year by Nance and
Naps. By then I knew that I wouldn't really work it into the class but
I felt that it explained things, the data structures and algorithms in
particular very well. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's one thing I always look for in a text book. If I'm not tightly
integrating the text then I want the text to be a worthwhile resource
for the student. If a kid doesn't get it in class I want the text book
to be a second chance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When we moved to C++ we moved to Nance and Naps for the language and
Nance and Lambert for the Data Structures. Somehow I got the school to
fund both books. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Everything changed when the AP class went to Java. I never found a
Java based book that covered the data structures in a way I liked but
finding a text was a problem even beyond that hurdle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of the Java based texts tightly integrated with some project or
library provide by the author. It was just like the AP case study. If
the case study worked well into your course and the way you taught it
was great, otherwise it was a bear to deal with. I settled on Lewis
and Loftus which integrated their own graphics library but always as
an add on to each chapter rather than tightly integrated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For my homebrew classes, I've never found a single textbook. The nice
thing today is that there are so many resources already
available. Tutorials, videos, online practice sites like codingbat and
more. There are also a number of authors who make their books
available online for free. I use one - &lt;a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff with
Python&lt;/a&gt; in one of my classes but I purchased a copy for myself and
encourage my students to do so as well if/when they're able to based
on economic situation. Usually I can cobble together a good set of
resources for the students that are both free and probably superior to
any single text book out there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this said, it's important that students have resources
independent of the teacher. If you can get a good textbook, that can
be it but fortunately, in this day and age we have many great
alternatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Is Teaching CS Hard?</title>

&lt;h2 id="orgb0215e3"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0215e3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last week, Mark Guzdial asked &lt;a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/01/19/what-does-it-mean-for-computer-science-to-be-harder-to-learn-than-other-stem-subjects/"&gt;What does it mean for Computer Science to be harder to learn
than other STEM subjects?&lt;/a&gt; as a follow up to his &lt;a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/224105-learning-computer-science-is-different-than-learning-other-stem-disciplines/fulltext"&gt;ACM Blog post&lt;/a&gt; this
month and the ensuing discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You should read both posts but here's how Mark started off the follow
up:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I made an argument in my Blog@CACM Post for this month that “Learning
Computer Science is Different than Learning Other STEM Disciplines,”
and on Twitter, I explicitly added “It’s harder.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you talk about how hard or easy it is to teach a subject you can
do so at many levels. college, high school, middle etc.. Since most of
my career has been as a High School guy, let's focus there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do in fact believe that it is hard to teach CS, at least to do it
well but is it harder to teach then other STEM subjects?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's see how we're doing in those other subjects. I took a look at
the New York State &lt;a href="https://data.nysed.gov/reportcard.php?instid=800000081568&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;createreport=1&amp;amp;regents=1"&gt;Regents Exam&lt;/a&gt; results from 2015/2016. I'm certainly
not a believer or supporter of standardized tests but they're a
convenient measure for the sake of this post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Only 58% of test takers scored 65 or higher on Integrated Algebra and
only 41% scored 3 (proficient) or higher on the Common Core version
with far more students taking the Common Core exam.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Higher performing schools frequently offer Algebra in 8th grade but in
the lower performing districts, students frequently take it over the
course of two years. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Geometry regents boasts a passing rate of about 40%. Trig does a
little better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The science regents exams look a little better but overall, these are
not terrific results, particularly on the classes that are required
for graduation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It seems that those other STEM fields aren't so easy to teach after all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand we have CS. If you listen to all the press releases
and media attention on APCS-P from this past year it would seem that
CS is easy to teach and learn. We have all these high school students
mastering a "college level" course and we can prepare teachers to be
master CS instructions with just a bit of in-service professional
development.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is, of course that CS isn't easy to teach. When you're a
summer or after school program or even an elective it's easy to create
a fun experience using shiny tools to self selecting students but when
you have to take everyone and prepare many of them to succeed in more
advanced classes we have a real challenge. We really should be looking
at retention in more advanced CS classes rather than just passing the
intro ones. Most students won't go beyond the intro class in any given
subject but the ones that do must be well prepared. Unfortunately, I
fear that the people who will get the blame when kids drop CS later on
will be the teachers of the more advanced classes regardless of who,
if anyone, is at fault.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teaching CS is hard. It's brand new and very open ended.  When
programming a solution to a problem kids start with a blank
slate. They don't have the library of patterns, vocabulary or &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/programming-idioms"&gt;idioms&lt;/a&gt;
needed to build solitions. There are many ways a teacher can scaffold
the learning. Code tracing, analogies, Parsons problems and more but
the truth is teachers strong in both content and pedagogical knowledge
are still in rather short supply and as Mark wrote on his blog the
body of knowledge on teaching CS is just not that mature.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, Algebra students usually had a first look at some
of the topics prior to the class and much of the class can be
"learned" through memorizing relatively short procedures and
patterns. This might not lead to a depth of understanding but it does
get you past standardized tests. On the science side, the Living
Environment exam is really just a reading test.  On the other hand,
we're supposed to start teaching proof to students in Geometry and
that's really hard to do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, teaching in general is hard and teaching CS is no exception. At
least it is if you're doing it right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Reading and Writing Recs</title>

&lt;h2 id="org025384e"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org025384e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been on both sides of the recommendation game. I currently read
all the recommendations for students who apply to my &lt;a href="http://info.huntercs.org"&gt;honors CS program&lt;/a&gt;
at Hunter and some of the ones written for the Macaulay Honors
program. I also read some for the CSTUY summer program. On the other
side, I've written hundreds if not thousands of recs for seniors when
I was teaching at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been meaning to write about recs  and when I saw &lt;a href="http://avc.com/2018/01/some-thoughts-on-checking-references/"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;
on AVC.com I thought now would be a good time. While the situation is
not quite the same, much of what Fred wrote resonated strongly with
me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a lot of recs at Stuy. In a year after I taught juniors I'd
typically end up writing for anywhere between 40 and 75 kids and each
kid would apply to between 5 and 15 schools. Some were accepted early
and in many cases you use the same rec without tweaking for all the
kid's applications but it's still an enormous load.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also don't think I'm particularly good at it. Writing doesn't come
naturally to. That said, I try to do an honest job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first and most important thing I do is make sure each student
understands that I'm not trying to get that kid into their percieved
dream school. My job writing a rec is to contribute to a picture of
who they are as both a student and as a person. The hope is that the
college admissions people will be looking for best fit students and
that the picture the application creates makes the fit clear
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/reading-and-writing-recs/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Beyond that, I try to say something personal in each rec. Recount a
particular project or event. It's hard. It might be easier for
English teachers - English classes allow for much freer discussions
and assignments where students can reveal more about
themselves. It's harder in subjects like Math and Computer
Science. I'd invariably be asked to write recs for a number of kids –
good kids that were quiet, did there thing but to be honest, never
did much to stand out. I don't necessity mean stand out in terms of
grades, I mean in terms of making themselves known - revealing who
they were. I also try to keep recs short. Readers have a lot of these
to go through. I don't want to add to their load.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many teachers, including myself try to address this problem. We
interview the kids, have them write mini-essays and just plain
struggle when it comes time to write.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To make it more challenging, the deadlines are all together so you
have to get them all done in a short period of time and at the same
time not fall into the rut of having them sound all the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the reader side, similar to what Fred said about references, a lot
of it is about what isn't written and about how it's written. The
challenge is that my code as a reader might be different from the
teacher writing the rec. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The key thing I look for when reading is a connection between the
writer and the kid. Often I read a rec and could apply it equally well
to every applicant in the stack. I also know that when I write recs
I've been guilty of this and it really does nothing to help the
student. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also don't want to read about averages and test scores or anything
that's already covered in the application. I already get the numbers
and if a kid, let's say, volunteered at a community center, it's already on the
application. I don't want a teacher to mention it unless they
were involved or can otherwise add something that I wouldn't know just
from reading the appkication. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If I come away feeling that there's a connection between the teacher
and student that says a lot to me. It means the kid made an impression
on the teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For my Hunter Honors program I have an advantage (or possibly curse)
over when I read for other programs and this is similar to what Fred
wrote about following up on references. I know some of the teachers
writing the recs and I usually know teachers in the schools. Since the
number of applications I'm dealing with isn't huge, I can reach out to
my people and find out what's what. Last year I was able to justify
accepting a student based on additional information I was able to get
and now half a year later it's clear that the student is a terrific
fit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This would all be simpler if we didn't have to play games with
recommendations. When I was a teacher. rather than writing 50 - 70
recommendations, I'd rather have 20ish phone calls. One with each
school. I could briefly talk about the kids relative to each other and
to former students who went to any given institution and that's
that. It would be faster, easier, and fairer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="text-footnotes"&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/reading-and-writing-recs/#fnr.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara"&gt;Personally, I think the whole college application process is
both unfair and arbitrary but that's a discussion for another time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Advanced Placement Computer Science got top billing on Alfred
Thompson's &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/01/computer-science-education-things-im.html"&gt;Things I'm Watching in 2017&lt;/a&gt; post. Alfred talks about how
APCS-P exploded onto the scene and wonders what will happen with APCS
this year. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have some questions as well but mine won't be answered for years to
come, if ever. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Like it or not, the College Board has an out sized influence on K12
education. As long as people are convinced that AP=good there will be
a push for more and more AP classes and APCS-P is a perfect class to
push. CS is the hot topic in K12, the topic is getting a big push
from both politicians and industry, the class has no pre-requisites
and in spite of being called a college course is somehow appropriate
for a typical tenth grader.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The concern here is that at the end of the day. APCS-P is an exam or
rather an exam plus two other assessments. The quality can vary
greatly. I've heard of APCS-P implementations that seem pretty
rigorous and I've seen implementations that are, quite frankly, a
joke. The question is this: is APCS-P both motivating kids to go on to
the next level and just as importantly preparing them to succeed at
that level? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We might never know.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A high school might only offer APCS-P. If APCS-A isn't offered, we
might not know if the student went on to take more CS and we won't
know if the student succeeded or not. I've seen this with some very
high profile, popular, after school/summer non-profits. The kids have
a great time and the non-profits rave about how much their kids learn
but then the kids take a real CS class in school and drop like
flies. Was it the teacher/professor or did the non-profit set the kids up to
fail by convincing them they knew a whole lot more than they did and
that CS was super easy all the time. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If credit is given for APCS-P, it looks like it will be blanket
credit. CS majors and minors will still have to take all the same classes in
college and CS so it will be very hard to tell if APCS-P is
responsible for any uptick in CS. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, the College Board is going to make a lot of
money but if APCS-P becomes the standard high school CS course will
this leave us with true, quality CS4All? I have my doubts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
