Tomorrow morning I fly out to Seattle for SIGCSE 2017. For those of
you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for
Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've wanted to go for years but have never been able. It's hard for a
high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in
places with a school calendar similar to New York. NY city schools are
already closed for a week in February and then Spring Break is right
around the corner. If you're teaching an AP course with the exam in
early May, losing a week in March is really not an option. Even if you
can take the time, you'll probably have to foot the bill out of
pocket. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that I'm at Hunter, I've got more flexibility in terms of schedule
and attending is probably even more important given my current roles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to the talks and events but probably even more
looking forward to seeing old friends, meeting new ones and seeing
face to face friends that til now I've only known through the web.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On Saturday I'll be part of a panel (thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;) titled "Tools we
can't live without." I'll probably talk about the way I use git and
GitHub and how I get my students up to speed but there are lots of
tools I can talk about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I plan to write up a series of posts on how I use GitHub (and how it
evolved from other versioning systems) as well as thoughts about other
tools I've used and some I've struggled with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you're going to be at SIGCSE drop me a line, I'd love to connect.
