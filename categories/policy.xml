The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who's policies you strongly
disagreed with?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tough question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The original question implied national level positions. I've never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My take?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyone that knows me knows that I've had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they're
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked "do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out 
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?" I honestly
didn't know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE's sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO's As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I've been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I've had such a meeting, however, I've
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I'll always take a meeting and I'll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I've
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don't believe in.

This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the
past few weeks &lt;a href="http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/"&gt;http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/&lt;/a&gt;. It's from
2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then
with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date
and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for
lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My friend Alex  asked my thought about how we might deal with evaluating
teacher quality. I thought I'd share them here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alex listed a number of commonly tried and suggested options on
teacher evaluation and why they're all flawed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I haven't asked Alex's permission so I won't post his list and
comments here. Instead let's start with the boogeyman those that attack public
education always trot out – tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's get a couple of things straight - tenure is not a job for
life. For K12 teachers, it's the right to due process. That means you
can't be fired without cause. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hear the free market capitalists out there already – "in the real
world, you're an at will employee, why do teachers need this due
process?" - I'll get to that down below. For now, let's look at a few
points on tenure:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First - you can fire a tenured teacher, you just have to document your
case. This means that the supervisor has to actually do their job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next - people can complain about rubber rooms and the time it takes to
fire one of these tenured teachers. That's because the DOE won't hire
sufficient hearing officers. In a recently resolved case, a friend of
mine - a terrific AP was finally returned to her post after she was
railroaded on false charges. She was in the rubber room for years. The
DOE kept delaying the process – all she wanted was to go to "trial"
since everyone knew she'd be exonerated - the fact that she was up on
charges at all speaks to why teachers need tenure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next - teachers don't grant tenure, the administration does. Why are
all these horrible teachers being granted tenure? Stories abound of
administrators granting tenure to bad teachers so long as they
transfer to another school - who's to blame here? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the contract that establishes tenure is jointly negotiated
by the teachers union and the city - no one ever seems to complain
about the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next, let's talk about bonuses and competition. People in the business
world take the false assumption that everyone thinks, acts, and feels like
they do. Here's a surprising fact – teachers aren't in it for the
money. Sure, we'd like to make a little more - perhaps enough to
actually  live in a decent apartment and not need a second job to make
ends meet -  but no one went into teaching to get rich. Teachers are in
it to uplift ALL their students and their school as a whole. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now let's look at the model currently in vogue - value added
measures. Besides the fact that they're arbitrary and don't work (see
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.md/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2.md/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) they're nothing like how people are evaluated
in the real world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How are people evaluated in regular jobs? As far as I know, they're
evaluated by their managers and bosses - possibly also by their peers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing - that's how teachers used to be evaluated before all this
nonsense brought about by the "reformers." Of course, no one will
admit to this. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Did this system work? For the most part, but not entirely. Why were
there problems? Because, unlike a business, principals are not
necessarily incentivized to have the best teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Schools and principals are evaluated on ridiculous metrics - the same
standardized tests they use to evaluate teachers. To look at a small
piece – to graduate high school, kids need to pass at least one math
regents and pass three years of math classes. To be "college ready" a
student still only needs to pass one math regents and take at least
one year of geometry or trig.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This means that as far as math is concerned, a principal is
incentivized to have a math department that can get their kids through
the algebra regents. Here's how this frequently plays out. The kids
take algebra over two years and then passes the exam. The kids take
geometry as their third year. They don't have to pass the regents, but
it appears that in order to increase a student's chances of passing
that exam, classes don't teach proof - the most important and hardest
part of the class. Why not? Because it's easier to pass the exam by
learning most of the other stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here we have a school where the incentive is to hire teachers that can
teach to the algebra regents and that's about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's at a school with a low performing population. In a higher
performing school, the kids will do well on the standardized tests
regardless of teacher quality so there's no incentive to hire the
best. Even if that's what they want to do, there's no way to know if
they're actually doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back to why teachers need due process. Since principals aren't held
accountable in any reasonable way, teachers can't be. The end result
is that teachers are subject to abuses by principals. I myself was
once brought up on bogus charges raised by a principal (not a Stuy
one) who wanted to make trouble. Without due process, I would be out
of a job. So would many others.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The answer? To me it's figure out how to hold principals
accountable. In Alex's Facebook post he  mentions evaluation by
college and workforce success but that has a slow feedback loop. The
truth is, education does have a slow feedback loop. Schools, however,
exist for along time and principals should have tenure periods of more than
just a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My feelings? Why not look at graduates succeeding in college or on the
tax rolls? This wouldn't be perfect but it would be a start. While NY
can't count on private universities sharing accurate information in a
timely manner there should be a way of tracking if a high school
graduate is enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY one, two, three, or four
semesters after graduation. Create a baseline for a school and start
from there. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If principals were actually accountable in a reasonable
way they'd have incentive to have the best teachers. Then we can get
back to the old system which was indeed the way the "real world"
works.

If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
&lt;a href="http://avc.com"&gt;avc.com&lt;/a&gt;, Today, &lt;a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/"&gt;Fred's post&lt;/a&gt; talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We don't need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Return readers know that I've ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I've periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I've also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that &lt;a href="https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/"&gt;the emperor has no clothes&lt;/a&gt;, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some workforce programs like &lt;a href="https://perscholas.org/"&gt;Per Scholas&lt;/a&gt; that I really like
and respect but they're limited in what they can do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they'll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It's small
and has flown under the radar but it's one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I haven't written much about what's been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city's tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>education</category><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 23:13:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Computational Thinkers in Scotland</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm way behind on my &lt;a href="http://cacm.acm.org/"&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/a&gt;. I generally only read
them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and
outside riding, I'm still on the December 2015 issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on &lt;a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/12/194638-creating-a-new-generation-of-computational-thinkers/abstract"&gt;a
program in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. If you're an ACM member, and if you're a CS
practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
Me? I noticed a number of similarities between what Bundy and Scott
described and efforts here in the USA including some of the red flags.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not here to talk about the program described in detail or their
successes and failures. I don't have enough information to fairly
comment on that. I'm here in my usual role of curmudgeon to highlight
common red flags that if unheeded could cost all of us the opportunity
to get really great CS Ed to all of our students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One red flag right away were a number of references to the program
being curriculum and materials driven, not teacher driven. The
viewpoint states that materials "were designed to be used by even
non-specialist teachers." We see the same thing here in the USA and
not just in CS Ed. Teaching overall is being devalued with the elite
pushing programs that handcuff good teachers to a script (which leads
students towards "success" in passing a nonsense standardized exam)
all the while sending their own kids to elite private schools with
knowledgeable teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know i didn't want my kids to be taught chemistry history or any
other subject by a teacher that hasn't studied the content yet here we
go saying it's okay for CS. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The counter argument is that we have to do something now and we'll do
better later. We all go in with the best of intentions but more often
than not, once a politician has their sound bite and once a cheap
apparent solution is in place, it's good enough and we're done. I
ranted about that a while back both &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.V-5UqN9vGAk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.V-5Uot9vGAk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To their credit,
Bundy and Scott talk a bit about this concern in the piece.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The piece also said "It is also necessary to employ a pedagogy that is
informed by the latest research into the most effective ways to teach
computing." This sounds good but the truth is, education research
doesn't have the best reputation among educators. Last month, I
asked one of the best math teachers around what was being bandied
about as best practices in math education according to "the
research?" He basically said "the research says do &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;fad du jour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
but that doesn't work for me so I just do &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;actually good technique&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I've spoken to many teachers and by and large the best
ones discredit "the research." Of course, my comment will be
discredited by ed researchers saying that "you're just giving
anecdotes" but then, if I did the same thing while employed as a
researcher, did a couple of surveys and submitted it for publication,
then it would be "research." So much of teaching is a craft and the
truth is, practitioners know best.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Related to this is authentication by citing authority. Particularly
dangerous in our field because many people with little to no real
background in teaching CS are anointed as experts and thought leaders
(see this post: &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-26-self-appointed-experts.html/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, the viewpoint cites Cameron
Fadjo. I've only met Cameron once or twice and he seems like a sharp
guy but when he was given the post of Director of Software Engineering
for NYC, according to his linked in profile, he had neither taught k12
nor had any real CS background.  This is of course the profile of many
CS Education thought leaders. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My overall take. It sounds like just like here, Scotland has people
trying to make a difference and trying to do good. It also sounds like
they're falling into the same traps and pitfalls as we are on this
side of the Atlantic.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cs</category><category>education</category><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 11:28:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Federal Aid for Code Schools - is this a good thing?</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/fed-aid-for-code-schools/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw this headline earlier today: &lt;a href="http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/coding-bootcamps-just-got-a-big-boost.html"&gt;The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools
will be able to accept federal student aid. I don't know if we're
talking student loans or  grants but I'm not sure it matters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The headline sounds great. I'm not so sure that this is a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My thinking's evolved over the years but right now, everything tells
me that public funds and for profit education don't mix.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What we, more often than not, end up with is a cash cow for a private concern. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Example one: The edTPA - a required exam for teacher licensing, at
least in NY. Prospective teachers pay hundreds of dollars to pass this
gatekeeper. Pearson, a private company (and not even an American one)
is essentially in charge of teacher licensing. They make the
assessments, they grade them, they decide who passes. A foreign
company is deciding who teaches our kids and at great expense to those
prospective teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We'd be much better off going back to the old days. To become a
teacher, you had to pass through "The board of examiners." Basically,
to get your permanent license you had to do an oral defense. Teachers
would be placed in a room of principals, supervisors, and master
teachers for an open grilling. It was cheaper and MUCH more
effective. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Example two: The PSAT 8/9, PSAT, and SAT. These are exams that tell us
one thing: how kids will do on future PSAT and SAT tests. They're not
good predictors of college success but the college board (a non-profit
in name only) has convinced us, or at least "convinced" our
politicians of the exams importance. So, rather than having
individuals make a choice as to whether or not to take these exams, NY
forks over who knows how much money per year so that our kids can take
a test with the belief that the exam will mystically make them college
ready. To make matters worse, students lose a day of instruction and
teachers have to proctor the exam instead of teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Example three: Common core tests. Made in secret, graded in secret
with cut off scores designed after the fact. Absolutely no educational
value but once again, public funds flow freely into testing companies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that these private concerns never really have to show
results and they're never held accountable and since the money we pay
them is hidden in city and state budgets, the taxpayer is none the wiser.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what about code schools?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a similar vein, money will flow from the government to the code
schools. The question is, do they really have the secret sauce.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have lots of friends who run and work in code schools and have met
many more. Some code schools are trying to really educate and some
not so much. In any case, let's take a look.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You frequently hear about the success stories but for every one of
those, you can also find a manager talking about the fact that the
code school graduate can't do anything other than ape the narrow tool
that they were exposed to in the three or so months at the code
school. So, the truth is that results are probably a mixed bag.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is this good? Well, when you consider the typical code school MO it
really isn't.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To attend a for profit code school you have to not only afford the
tuition but also be able to sustain yourself for the duration of the
program. That makes most code schools options for the well to do -
those already well positioned for success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then they make the candidates go through pre-work – frequently online
course work. So, before you even step into a code school, they know
you're likely going to succeed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once in, they train the candidates in a narrow slice of tech. I've
talked to a number of code school leaders about that. I've asked how
well the kids would be able to adapt given the constraints of their 3
month or so training. The typical answer was that the candidate could
just re-up and pay again to learn the next limited time only skill.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Should taxpayer dollars go to this? Probably not. There's no
indication that code schools can provide meaningful long lasting
education to even those who are best prepared to learn on their
own. Whats' more, we haven't seen evidence that they have the answers
for the under-served. Combine that with government's history of not
keeping an eye on and not holding accountable private education
providers, I think we're just setting up a new line of corporate
welfare that will, on the surface help some but it is in no way the
answer. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Too often public/private means that the private entity gets the money
and the public gets stuck holding the bag. Better would be to have
tech companies foot the bill. Some coding schools already do
this. Tech companies that are happy with coding school graduates can
finance the program. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What we should be doing is focusing on things like community
colleges. Organizations that are supposed to be real, long term,
community centers. With moderate tweaking, there's no reason why a
community college, not to mention 4 year schools, couldn't provide far
superior preparation than even the best code school.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Eliot titled the post "Innovate vs Appropriate" and talks about the
importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to
use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is
discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it's well worth a read
but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to "disrupt"
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've witnessed this disruption or Ed Reform for the last decade
plus. The basic notion that public education isn't working so we need
to disrupt things. We've suffered through:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vouchers
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charters
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online "learning" replacing teachers
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach for America and other temp type efforts
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merit pay
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VAM for teacher evaluation
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These disruptions are brought to you by your friendly neighborhood
billionaire "philanthropist" or your politicians.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By and large, they haven't worked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bill Gates got us to close down community schools and create small
ones. While we did need more small schools, overall it didn't work
(&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-epstein/small-schools-miracle-or_b_2641400.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). VAM teacher evaluation is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A"&gt;arbitrary and capricious&lt;/a&gt;,
merit pay has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-why-merit-pay-for-teachers-doesnt-work/2011/03/29/AFn5w9yB_blog.html"&gt;never worked&lt;/a&gt;, nor does the &lt;a href="http://educationnext.org/online-charters-mostly-dont-work-forum-virtual-schools-greg-richmond/"&gt;online thing&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, charter
schools by and large &lt;a href="http://www.nea.org/home/32999.htm"&gt;don't do better&lt;/a&gt; than public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than saving our schools, these efforts have lowered teacher
morale and done little for our most vulnerable children.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what's the difference between ed disruption and the tech world?
Well, for starters, those disrupting education totally ignore the very
advice that Eliot posted about today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Disruption to and of our public schools hasn't been a matter
appropriating what works and innovating what needs to be innovated but rather
a playground for pet projects of politicians and well meaning rich
folk.  Rather than looking at something simple that works, like, say,
smaller class sizes, we get computerized testing. Instead of
experienced teachers, we get inexperienced newbies that leave after
their commitment is up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why the difference? It hit me while reading Eliot's post. When a
founder is "disrupting" he has skin in the game - it's his company -
sink or swim. Not so for education reformers. Politicians merely need
to be re-elected.Sso as long as something looks good short term, it is
good. Those who disrupt schools are never held accountable. We got
small schools and VAM from among other places, Bill Gates. He admitted
his reforms didn't work but was there any penalty for disrupting so
many lives? Nope. For politicians, it's the same story. As Mayor Mike
Bloomberg once said "If they don't like my education policy, they can
boo me at parades."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Can we fix this? Sure, but not unless those forcing the changes have
real skin in the game. Will it happen? I'm not holding my breath.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>disruption</category><category>education</category><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ed-disrupt-why-diff/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 23:32:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hillary and Student Loans</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hillary-loans/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I read over Hillary's briefing on her initiative on
&lt;a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/"&gt;Technology and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she's pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don't want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some initial responses from the education community is "what about
young teachers, don't they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…" and of course they're right. On the other hand, I
don't want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That's the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But again, that's not where I'm going with this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's start with "who are these founders?" I don't have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This alone makes Hillary's plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
"explore similar incentives"  for early employees, citing "10 to 20."
This doesn't seem right to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now let's look further into the benefits. I don't know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I've seen a bunch of
figures including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of startups fail within the first three years
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three out of four startups fail 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
others turn a profit.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know where the truth lies but I'd imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hillary's plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So there it is. A plan that makes for great "press release" but is it
really addressing the issues?

I spent the last couple of days attending &lt;a href="http://go.personaldemocracy.com/"&gt;Personal Democracy Forum
2016&lt;/a&gt;, described on their landing site as:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The world’s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology's
impact on politics, government, and society.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's the reason why I haven't posted my latest Emacs video.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important
issues. I'll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One topic that I've already lamented about has been the way we as a
society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms
like Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use Facebook as much as the next guy but it always irks me when I
see a CS Education post followed by rich discussion hidden within
Facebook's walls and not available for discovery to the outside world
and the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I generally don't get a lot of comments on my posts, but when I do,
more appear in the Facebook link to my post rather than publicly on
the post itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the conference, we watched a video by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan"&gt;Hossein Derakhshan&lt;/a&gt; which
talked about the direction the web is moving in and the red flags it
should raise with all of us. He echoed my concerns and beyond but in a much more
eloquent way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm urging you to take the less than ten minutes to watch this
video. I know school's winding down for all of us but for those of you
who are teachers out there - share this with your students. I'm sure a
rich discussion will follow.
&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of &lt;a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/"&gt;Navajo Math Circles&lt;/a&gt;, a
documentary on a &lt;a href="http://www.mathcircles.org/"&gt;Math Circle&lt;/a&gt; put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I'm most familiar with the &lt;a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/"&gt;New York Math Circle&lt;/a&gt;. I'm friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As someone who's worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they've started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what's
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it's something
we're losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
"making the work interesting and relevant to the student" but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what's the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Math Circle is fun!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that says it all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son's best teachers, &lt;a href="http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx"&gt;Paula Rogovin&lt;/a&gt; did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Until we win back public education it's important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
&lt;a href="http://cstuy.org"&gt;CSTUY&lt;/a&gt;) and it's also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't been teaching this past semester. That's why I haven't been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt; recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it's locked in the Facebook silo. I've got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let's focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about it on his blog &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox based solutions
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailing projects
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
or other repository hosting services
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Interesting enough, I've gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I keep hearing "the kids will copy from each other" or something like
that. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As Alfred said in his post: "Students have been copying from
classmates for years."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we've
been teaching CS and they'll be doing it for years to come. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using a hidden submission system doesn't help and could hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a win all around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what do I do on the cheating front?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I'll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
GitHub also gives tools that help. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the GitHub graph for a project:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/github-graph.png" alt="github-graph.png" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Technology isn't going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don't stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
