&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend was &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskills Conf&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite events of the
year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you know my wife, you know she's &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; knitting. Ok, not true,
she's always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form
of fiber craft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I can't complain. That's how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy
and Kandinsky sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks. It also
keeps her an my entire family in warm amazingly beautiful knit wear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While at the conference, Devorah was her usual self - knitting during
the talks. That doesn't mean she wasn't paying attention, it's just
what she does. We also noted a few other attendees knitting throughout
the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, this year, Devorah had an idea – let's focus those idle hands to
do some good. She asked the conference organizers to send out an email
to attendees - knit squares during the conference and Devorah will put
them together at the end and we'll donate the blanket we make to
children in need through &lt;a href="https://projectlinus.org/"&gt;Project Linus&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The organizers were supportive, if not somewhat skeptical. That was
ok - we also had no idea if this would be a win or a flop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conference came and Devorah announced the project. She brought yarn,
needles, crochet hooks and instructions and also offered to teach
knitting during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It started slowly, but as the conference progressed, people started
knitting both during the talks and during the breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; leading knitting for children in need at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hn0rx633e1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hn0rx633e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/789839861813575680"&gt;October 22, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Experienced knitters cranked out squares and newbies learned.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/knitting-tech-conference/learning.jpg" alt="learning.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jcn"&gt;@jcn&lt;/a&gt; knitting for charity with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rvkSnMYDCp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rvkSnMYDCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790164027494326272"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the conference, we collected the partials. Devorah's
going to finish the blanket up this week and then it gets donated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;6 X 5 and growing! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/epC9b3ap0t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epC9b3ap0t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/790697247965151232"&gt;October 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how much of a win was this? We got a blanket to donate to charity
and a couple of new knitters. We also heard and overheard some
interesting comments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One speaker commented that it as much better to see members of the
audience knitting for good rather than checking their cell phones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also overheard some attendees talking about how the knitting
project left them feeling more connected to the conference since they
were able to contribute something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like a pretty big win to me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So much so that Devorah's thinking about taking the show on the road -
maybe other conferences would like their idle hands doing some good
while listening to talks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Waking up to a beautiful brisk morning at the Ashokan Center in the Hudson Valley.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last year, Devorah and I attended the first &lt;a href="http://catskillsconf.com"&gt;Catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;, a tech
conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique
experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer
camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"&gt;Dennis Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and
an alos hear the music of &lt;a href="http://www.mikeandruthy.com/"&gt;Mike and ruthy&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I gave another educaiton rant and to add to the fun,
Devorah's been leading a knitting for Charity project and teaching
attendees to knit:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Progress on the charity knitting project led by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky"&gt;@DevorahZamansky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/catskillsconf?src=hash"&gt;#catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yoal7r48wO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yoal7r48wO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/790155915307737088"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and we brought up my Hunter College students to join in the fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In spite of the fact that we were out late at the bonfiere:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending a great day by relaxing next to the fire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf"&gt;@catskillsconf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LzKbftZamz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LzKbftZamz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christopher Short (@Shortoutloud) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shortoutloud/status/790020785943539712"&gt;October 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and then were kept up by the students bonding and chatting in the
bunkhouse, Devorah and I are first up, bright and early.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll write up more about this amazing event some time over the
week. Right now, I think I'll just go out and enjoy a cup of coffee
and the clean brisk Hudson Valley air.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>community</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskillsconf-2016/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2016 11:19:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Can NYCIST become in leader in CS Education?</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/nycist/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I only learned about NYCIST last spring. They're the "New York
Consortium for Independent School Technologists." They had something
of an open house that I attended. I heard about them from friend
and fellow CS educator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber Khan&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last Thursday I spent an afternoon and evening with NYCIST members for
a discussion of the state of K12 Computer Science Education in the
City.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most of my work has been with public schools and most of the teachers
I know, public school teachers so it was great to make new friends in
the Independent school community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One thing I realized during the evening was that NYCIST has a real
opportunity to do something special. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, the public schools are leading the way in computer
science education as a result of this administrations CS4All
initiative but at the same time, public schools face some real
challenges. While some "early adopters" have developed their own take
on computer science education, by and large, CS4All is being defined
and driven by few for all and, at least right now, the model seems to
be the "a little PD and you're a CS teacher" model.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, standardized testing and teacher evaluations are
pressuring schools, particularly schools of our most vulnerable
students to push resources towards test prep in tested subjects rather
than real education, including CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this particular instance, NYCIST and independent schools can be
what charter schools were supposed to be before they were corrupted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Laboratories of innovation. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NYCIST has already gathered together interested parties and the
independent schools aren't burdened by the weight of politically
driven testing and teacher evaluation. At the same time, small class
sizes and flexible models allow for innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If they wanted to, they could probably create curricular and
instructional frameworks for CS education and. dare I say it, share it
back to the public schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know I'm ignoring independent school politics and other issues that
would prevent this from happening, but I just feel that if there's a
desire to do so from a group like NYCIST, it could happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to continuing to work with my new friends and if
any of you are interested in finding out more about NYCIST, just tweet
to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ed_saber"&gt;Saber&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if my idea here will take root but if it does, I'd love
to work with NYCIST to make something happen.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>community</category><category>cs</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/nycist/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2016 20:17:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Impostor Syndrome - I'm not good enough</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/imposters/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I've been meaning to comment on these tweets for a while:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I went to high school with some scary smart people. Never made math team. Didn't get into honors math. Thought I wasn't good at it.&lt;/p&gt;— Stanislav Nikolov (@snikolov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov/status/748660381392871424"&gt;June 30, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zamansky"&gt;@zamansky&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that's the thing though you can get such an inferiority complex by always comparing yourself to others &lt;a href="https://t.co/LvaMjp1WVf"&gt;https://t.co/LvaMjp1WVf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stanislav Nikolov (@snikolov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov/status/748918417667727360"&gt;July 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stan, of course, is one of the most talented people I know. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It reminded me of a conversation I had with my colleague and friend
Jim last year. I had just recieved an email from a former student
turned friend. We were trying to find some time to catch up.  I told
Jim I had just heard from this young lady and Jim replied "I remember
her, she's awesome. Really smart." I mention this because the
individual we were talking about, while to us, extremely talented in
addition to being just a terrific person spent much of her career
living in self doubt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Meantime, I was having a conversation with another friend and the
topic turned to impostor syndrome and the desire to make it a thing of
the past.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Problem is, I don't know if that will ever be the case. I'm
approaching 50 and have a career of good work behind me but I still
find myself questioning my credentials, work, and ability. Then I realized I wasn't alone
when I read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobertTalbert"&gt;Robert Talbert's&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href="http://rtalbert.org/blog/2016/tenure-second-time"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about his going through
the tenure process for a second time and "learning through this process
that I have not outrun impostor syndrome and probably never will."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stan's tweets tell part of the story. When we surround ourselves with
smart, accomplished people, we sometimes feel we don't measure
up. I've found that for the most part, the extremely accomplished
people I've worked with are very unassuming and low key. They seem to
operate assuming that  everyone else is at least as capable and quick as
they. I recall &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; talking about this in an essay but
I don't remember which one. The problem is, if you don't understand
their sincerity, you end up feeling even more inadequate. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It gets worse when we start comparing ourselves to some unreal
composite. I remember feeling pretty stupid back when I was younger
comparing myself with others. The problem was that I clearly didn't
measure up to the best math kid, or the best computer kid, the best
fencer, the best violinist, etc. Now, the best math kid might have
been a lousy athlete and the best fencer, a so so mathematician, but
to me, I was comparing myself with this composite super human. No
wonder I never measured up. Eventually, though, I realized three
things. First, there's always someone better at something and always
someone worse. Second, that's not the true value of ones worth as a
person, and three, I bring some good stuff to the table and I should
be (and am) content with that
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I still struggle with impostor syndrome but at the end of the day,
it just serves as a reminder to look back on what I've done and what
I've learned in the process.  I start out in question but in the end,
leave confident. Maybe the trick isn't to eliminate impostor syndrome
but rather to understand and contain it. We don't want to live in fear
and anxiety but both are useful emotions when we control them and not
the reverse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's probably good when we question ourselves and re-evaluate our
positions - we just have to make sure as we're bringing new people
into the tech fold that we foster acceptance and confidence  and when
impostor syndrome sets in that it can be channeled into a positive
and not scare people away.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>community</category><category>education</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/imposters/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2016 17:53:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>West coast trip - a nice close to act I</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/facebook.jpg" alt="facebook.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of
Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching
career, then our family's West Coast swing was a nice way to pull
down the curtain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she's interning at
Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south
to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle
for a couple of days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, while out there, why not see if some of the StuyCS family
wanted to get together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I knew I had a lot of former students out on the West Coast but still, I was
overwhelmed and humbled by the number of people who wanted to spend
time and catch up. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We kicked things off at Bloomberg Beta thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat"&gt;Roy Bahat.&lt;/a&gt; Roy was
never actually my student but we've gotten to know each other over the
years and I value him as a friend and advisor. Roy provided the food
and the space and about 60 former students + a few old timers showed.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/bloomberg.jpg" alt="bloomberg.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of days later, we had a lunch meetup for the Googlers:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/google.jpg" alt="google.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and a happy hour at Facebook (sorry, no picture). Then in Seattle, a
nice dinner to close things out.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/end-act-1/seattle.jpg" alt="seattle.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Between these events there were some lunches, a barbecue at Batya's
place  and even a drive by visit with a former student at
Microsoft. Overall, it was easily over 100 students over the course of
the week or so we were out there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've often said that one of the things I'm proudest of is helping to
build the StuyCS family. A community of people spanning decades. Over
the week, we had events mixing students from the mid 90's to
youngsters currently in college and on their internships.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seeing all these people meeting and supporting each other gave me a
"proud pappa" type feeling even though I didn't do any more than set
the stage for them getting together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the week, the conversations were also great - not the straight
tech ones, but the ones that really made me proud of the crew. From
Seth talking about how to better get good CS Ed to more kids, to PJ
discussing why he feels it's so important to be an active mentor to
his young programmers and how to get them to be real thinkers, to
Mike, Sam, Kathy, and Leo discussing the disconnect between
privileged families and those struggling to get by. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What more could a teacher want than their former students being both
happy in their lives and careers as well as good people seeking to
make the world better for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The only thing that made me sad about the trip is that with all the
big events, I really didn't get a chance to spend the time I wanted
with everyone. I hope to do better next time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I've now been at Hunter for one semester and things will really
ramp up in the Fall. I'm still a proud part of our StuyCS family and if
being a part of pulling it together is the legacy I left, I can live
with that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The trip was a nice symbolic way to lower the curtain on act 1. I'm
counting on the StuyCS family and all the other players to help so
that we can make sure act 2 is a success and we can build something
similar for more young people throughout the city and perhaps the country. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In response to the past couple of days where my friends and fellow CS
Ed advocates Alfred Thompson, Rob Underwood, and I had a nice little
discussion via our blogs, Alfred wrote &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/01/when-blogging-works-for-educators.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's great when a number of voices in the community have an open
discussion but one of the things I found myself lamenting was the fact
that a lot of the discussion isn't truly accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why not? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The silo known as Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have no problem with Facebook - I like it and use it daily - it's a great way to
keep in touch with former students turned friends. The problem is that
much like Las Vegas, discussions that happen on Facebook stay on
Facebook.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I've seen a number of blog posts, some mine, some Alfred's,
some others where the post garnered nary a comment. Head over to
Facebook  and if you're friends with the right people, you might find
a lively, informative discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In one case in particular, one post had independent, overlapping
discussions in at least three Facebook threads.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How much richer would the discussion have been  in a public forum
plus it would be left open for people to discover in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I use &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;. I like it since I can also follow people on
it and I can just embed the code in any page but others like what
Wordpress or Blogger uses for comment threads. In any event, it keeps
the conversation open.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is this really a problem? Maybe not but I do wish people would look
beyond Facebook for discussions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's something I've been trying to get my students to do for
years. I've used a number of tools for class communication:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mail lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piazza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;custom forum software like vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and haven't found anything that really does the job quite right. I'm
still looking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The kids use these but invariably end up also setting up a Facebook
group for my class and their other classes. I encourage this - they
certainly should have a forum that I can't see. How else can they plan
that surprise party for me :-). In all seriousness though, ideally
they should have a forum free of teachers but they should use the one
with the teacher as much as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The real problem with the kids setting up Facebook groups every year
is that there's no institutional memory. I see the kids, year after
year, have to clear the same hurdles. If they started thinking outside
of the silo of their Facebook communities and just had an ongoing
community for each class - one that passed on from year to year, it
would be of tremendous value for them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I'd like to encourage everyone out there to get our discussions
out into public forums. It would be terrific if more of us would blog
or blog more often and also to take the time to add to the dialog in a
public place.

&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it
turns out to be a really good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groo_the_Wanderer"&gt;Groo
the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school
before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few
teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't
know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over each of the next 20 Halloweens, I did something
different. Sometimes solo, sometimes as a pair and more recently as
part of a team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What started as a lark has now become something of an obligation but
it's still fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, with no further ado, let's go to the video tape:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81qHI-iNkXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And of course, the full playlist:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's Halloween again. This time, "Inside Out." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No video yet, but stay tuned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the time being, enjoy some of our past madness:
&lt;/p&gt;

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today marked the last day of classes and time for the 8th annual Stuy
CS Semi Formal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What's the Stuy CS Semi Formal? It's another bad idea that we refuse
to let die. Eight years ago JonAlf joked that someone in class joked
that they should have a party and they should all get dressed up. My
thought? "YEAH!!! LET'S DO IT!!!!!"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Eight years later, still going strong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We cleaned out and decorated the room - classed things up by serving
cheese, dried fruits, nuts and the like. Drinks served in fake plastic
"wine" glasses and we encouraged the kids to dress up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Pictures from the first year -  2007&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img width="350px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/last-day-2015/semi-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style="padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img width="350px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/last-day-2015/semi-2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;And from 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p style="float:left"&gt;
&lt;figure style="float:left;padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img width="350px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/last-day-2015/semi-3.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style="padding:20px"&gt;
 &lt;img width="350px" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/last-day-2015/semi-4.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Kids can come and go any period they don't have any other class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a signature event and a fun time. Whats more is that throughout
the day you've got pockets of CS students all dressed to the nines in
all their other classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the first few years JonAlf and I did the heavy lifting but these
past two, it's all been the students - particularly Jenny, Miranda,
and Veronika (apologies if I'm missing anyone).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's just another event that makes StuyCS unique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
