One of the things I mentioned in my post on the &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-educators-stackexchange/"&gt;CS Educators
StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My
friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate
as we're so young as a community. He's absolutely right but until we
mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources
and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and
discovering that they don't know about a site or a mailing list that
I've known about for years. Likewise, I'm appreciative when others
share resources with me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some collections of information, for instance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred
Thompson&lt;/a&gt; has a list of CS Education bloggers but it's not so easy to
discover and it certainly shouldn't fall on Alfred to maintain such
a list making sure the links are all active and always being
responsible for adding new ones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I've noticed a proliferation of &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
lists. These are community curated lists hosted up on GitHub for a
variety of projects. I find myself using &lt;a href="https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs"&gt;awesome-emacs&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python"&gt;awesome-python&lt;/a&gt; more and more and there are tons of other such lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I thought we, as a community could benefit from such a list. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started one off. It's over at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education"&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&lt;/a&gt; with instructions on
contributing at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org"&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I seeded it with a few items but I'd love everyone to get involved. I
also started it with a few categories and a specific format but I'd
love to see that evolve into something most useful for the community
as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you agree that this could be something useful, please contribute to
it and help spread the word.
