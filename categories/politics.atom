Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Long time blogger &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner"&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; put together &lt;a href="http://trumpstatus.org/"&gt;trumpstatus.org&lt;/a&gt; where he's
collecting many of these issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I've been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It's not quite as bad as:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Because people are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the time for business as
usual.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With yesterdays immigrant order, the whole tech community came out.
&lt;/p&gt;
