&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
One of my goals when I came over to Hunter was to help establish
Hunter CS as the place to be for CS in the city before I was done. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunter had a solid CS program before I joined but it isn't well
known. The school also doesn't have a well defined tech culture which
is both a good and bad thing. Hunter's also a commuter school and our
students face some challenges that are not as present at private
campus based schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe it's an overly ambitious goal but if it can be done, what a game
changer. A lot of people talk about equity, diversity, and social
justice but if we can establish Hunter as the place to be for CS, what
a win.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth of course is that I can't accomplish this - at least not by
myself. I'm just a teacher. Fortunately, there are so many wonderful
people in the New York Tech community that want to help bring
opportunities to the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last Thursday evening we got the ball rolling. Twenty five
representatives from the tech community got together at &lt;a href="http://yext.om"&gt;Yext&lt;/a&gt; with
about a dozen of our Hunter College CS students. The conversation
started with a discussion of perceptions of Hunter and the student
sharing what their experiences were like. By the end we were all
brainstorming as to how we can work together to best prepare Hunter
students to become members of the New York Tech community. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I know the students left the evening energized and I did as well. I
hope our friends in Tech felt the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We had representatives from (in alphabetical order)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animoto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beeswax&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
