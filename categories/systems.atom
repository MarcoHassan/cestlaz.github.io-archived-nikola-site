&lt;p&gt;
I wasn't going to go to this session. I started out in a panel on
integrating social good into CS Ed. With the panel not meeting my
expectations I moved over to my second choice - the system programming
sessions where I saw &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159597"&gt;Implementing Malloc: Students and Systems
Programming&lt;/a&gt;, a paper presented by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bpr/"&gt;Brian Railing&lt;/a&gt; of CMU.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I really like both the paper and the talk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
CMU computer science students all take a systems course that uses
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3/dp/9332573905/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=Y5ZKG2V8ZYZZPZHQP8SQ"&gt;Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great book. I
read through the first edition years ago and felt it was great
resource not only in a systems course but also for self study. One of
the labs has the students implement their own memory allocation calls,
or &lt;b&gt;malloc&lt;/b&gt; for us old time C wonks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were a number of self perceived  deficiencies with the
assignment such as it encouraging bad programming style by modeling
less than ideal practices but the biggest deficiency as that students
could game the assignment. Students could do very well on the
assignment by exploiting knowledge of the assignment rather than by
writing a full and correct malloc implementation. One example is that
students were able to figure out that no allocation would be more than
100MB so they really didn't have to deal with 64 bit pointers. Tey
could use smaller offsets thus simplifying the assignment. The
assignment became more about figuring out how to get it through the
grader and less about learning memory management. I'm sure I'm
overstating it but that's the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Railing explained all of the deficiencies and then how they changed
the assignment to address them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, the assignment had fewer loopholes to game so
students had to really write the malloc library and presumably learn
about memory management.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They also added an intermediate deliverable so students couldn't leave
everything for the last minute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Near the end of the talk, Railing discussed results where he pointed
out that students final exam scores didn't change but they did better
on the malloc questions. It wasn't clear if the overall scores didn't
change, meaning that the students did better on the malloc questions
but worse somewhere else or if they did similarly to past students on
the other sections and in addition they scored better on the malloc
questions. I'm not sold on the final exam questions being the best way
to evaluate learning but it is an easy data point. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I loved the presentation and paper and I love what Railing is doing
but my big takeaway was…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, Duh…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
