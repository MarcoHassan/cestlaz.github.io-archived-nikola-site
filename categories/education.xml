&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You've probably seen an image like this:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/dont-self-certify/self-signed.png" alt="self-signed.png" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's what you see when you try to access a secure web site but the web
site itself certified itself as being secure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When people see this on a professional site it sets off all manner of
red flags. We feel much more comfortable when go to a site and we
don't see that error. When we see the secure green lock in the url bar
indicating that this site is certified through an external trusted
source.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's take this a step further. If you needed surgery would you go to
a board certified surgeon or would you go to Dr. Nick Riviera or some
other "self certified" doctor? Likewise you wouldn't want to be
represented in court by someone who hasn't passed the bar. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We might not feel that these certification and licensing processes are
perfect but when we need the services of a doctor or lawyer, we're
happy these gatekeepers exist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So we should all be extremely concerned with today's announcement that
the deal for mayoral control just brokered in NYC came with strings
attached and one of those strings looks to open the doors to give some
charter chains the ability to self certify their teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a story on it in &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/06/with-city-charters-poised-to-win-certification-deal-education-schools-fret-113243"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/07/06/some-charter-school-teachers-could-become-certified-without-a-masters-under-proposed-new-suny-rules/"&gt;Chalkbeat&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One might think that some requirements to become a teacher are
ridiculous. I'll get to them later  but this is really giving the fox
the keys to the henhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Charters appear to have extremely high rates of teacher attrition so
it makes sense that they want to control their teacher pipeline. This
alone should be a red flag against self certification but what else
are charter chains known for?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misleading stats - claiming amazing passing numbers on standardized
exams while neglecting to mention that somehow or other big blocks
of students were removed from the school prior to the test year
(&lt;a href="http://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/student-attrition-and-backfilling-success-academy-charter-schools-what-student-enrollment"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gotta go list
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing high levels of parent involvement (tough for single working
parents)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charging &lt;a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/KIPP-schools-collected-millions-in-unallowable-11257006.php"&gt;illegal fees&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Top this off with as taking resources from public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Charters operate in anything but a transparent manner and we're
expected to trust them to prepare "highly effective" teachers? I don't
think so. Since there is no real accountability for charter schools -
they can easily game the system through student attrition, selective
admissions (by putting up barriers to enter the lottery) and test prep
they can pay lip service to teacher preparation and the public will be
none the wiser. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we had a reasonable way of holding principals accountable and no,
test scores are not the answer then we could pretty much do away
with teacher certification. If principals were held to task to run an
effective school, something we can easily define but not measure, then
they would have every incentive to hire the best
teachers. Unfortunately we're nowhere near that place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since we're not, we're left with the current systems of teacher
certification that has it's own slew of problems. A big part of it, in
my opinion is that schools of education have lost the high
ground. While there are some institutions doing great work, reputation
wise, schools of education are held in very low regard. Strong
teachers trade stories of the watered down content classes and waste
of time classes where professors share their pet theories of
education. I can't tell you how many times I've heard the new
definitive way to teach. At the same time, education research is
frequently held in low regard by teachers and the general public. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the one hand we have charters run by and support by non-educators
wanting us to trust them and on the other we have institutions that
are questioned by the teachers they produce and the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What a mess.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know the answer. I'm working on teacher certifications
programs at Hunter and it's a balancing act. How much content is
sufficient and how much is too much. Can any of the general content be
streamlined or is it all necessary. If it isn't necessary do we need
it anyway to satisfy the bean counters?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you don't have enough then we're sending unprepared teachers into
the classroom. Too much and we'll drive potential teachers away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As computer science education is defining itself we see similar
struggles. We have some people advocating certifications analogous to
existing teacher certifications. On the other extreme we have
advocates for two weeks summer training and you're a CS teacher. I'd
like to think that I'm advocating for the sweet spot. Strong content
knowledge not tied to a specific course and matching content related
pedagogy. Time will tell becomes the certification standard and time
will tell whose approach was right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For now, it's important not to give away the store. Private charter
schools should not be the driving force behind teacher certification
and they certainly shouldn't be allowed to train their own teachers
and then 'teach' our students without much greater scrutiny.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Addendum:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm sure some of my friends will point out that private schools aren't
held to any particular standard for teacher certification. This is
true but private schools don't take public funds. Actually they do but
in my opinion, they shouldn't. I maintain that charter schools are
publicly funded private schools in that they take public money but
operate as private entities. As such they should be held under the
greatest of scrutiny and standards â€“ they aren't
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in
conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy
about their results, some aren't, some don't really care.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't let your value be dictated by the college board or any other
  exam.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never really cared much about my students' actual AP scores. There
were a number of years when I never even saw the results. Of course, I
had a population that would do reasonably well regardless of teacher
so I was never placed under any pressure to "do better." One year -
while the APCS-AB exam was still offered, my principal called me down
to discuss the results to see if we could get more kids scoring 4s and
5s (which most of the kids already did). I told him that I thought
we were doing fine, explained why I couldn't advocate more teaching to
the test (such as more than paying lip service to the case study or
more rote practice on the multiple choice), and told him how I
measured our success as a program. He was happy with my answer and
that was that. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The AP exam is one test on one day and in my opinion the least
valuable measure of my students' achievement. This is one of
the reasons I was so dismayed by the CSEd community's efforts in
pushing the AP exams - not the class or the subject but the actual exam.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how should you judge your success? That's up to you. I can only
tell you how I judge myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First and foremost - and I know this sounds cheesy - are you a "force
for good" in your student's lives. Do you leave them in a better
place? Have you opened the door to a possible future for them? Have
you helped them grow? Beyond that, have they progressed in your
subject and as students in general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've had kids "fail" the AP exam and go on to wonderful careers in
tech and come back to thank me for giving them their start. I've also
had kids that have gone into other fields but appreciate what we've
done for them. I've also had my failures and I do mean my
failures. Students I couldn't reach or couldn't figure out how to
help.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As teachers, we work day to day trying to improve but we can get a
great overview of how we're doing by using a much longer feedback
loop - looking at what our graduates are up to. When young teachers
would comment on former students coming back or running into them at
tech events that they would have graduates of their own in a few years
and invariably they do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To really evaluate how you're doing you have to go with the long
game. Very few people get that. I remember talking to a Google
Executive while I was designing CAPE 2010. He said something to the
effect of "I know we won't know if this program works for about ten
years but we'll have to come up with something short term to satisfy
the powers that be."  That so few "get it" and need instant feedback
is one of the reasons that our society is so test driven. We shouldn't
be. Our focus should be on helping the students learn and progress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So don't get distressed over AP results and don't get to high on them
either. Certainly don't use them to drive what and how you teach. Let
your students and your conscience be your guide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is it easier to take CS people and teach them to teach or is it easier
to take teachers and teach them CS?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question gets batted around from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This time via twitter:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some think it's easier to teach a teacher to teach CS than to teach a CS pro to teach. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;@alfredtwo&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them &lt;a href="https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ"&gt;https://t.co/QCUP8d8llZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;â€” Diane Levitt (@diane_levitt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/881874056911388673"&gt;July 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Agreed. It takes a lot of work. More than a week long workshop.&lt;/p&gt;â€” Alfred Thompson (@alfredtwo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo/status/882243591090962432"&gt;July 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The conversation was referring to blog posts by &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/06/become-computer-science-teacher-in-five.html?spref=tw&amp;amp;m=1"&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/a-week-of-in-service-another-python-course/"&gt;Garth flint&lt;/a&gt;. 
Alfred's key point - one that I've spoken about before is that short
term professional development does not a CS teacher make.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to the lead in question? I've seen both routes succeed and both
routes fail. Both can be heavy lifts but there's a missing part of the
equation that's never addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The claim is that it's easier to teach CS to a non-CS teacher because
they already know how to teach. The problem is, particularly in the
later grades that teachers of different subject areas have very
different tool sets. Sure, there are common factors â€“ get the kids
involved, layer, spiral, etc. but you don't teach a CS lesson the same
way you teach a math lesson let alone a literature, history, language
lesson. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a math class, it's common to have students write solutions to
problems up on the board. If you try that in a CS class, you'll be
waiting 20 minutes while the kids transcribe the problems. Likewise,
math homework will likely consist of a certain amount of repetitive
practice problems whereas a CS class won't have something directly
analogous. This is not to say that you don't have opportunities for
students to present at the board in CS class or that there isn't
worthwhile homework but rather that even at this simple level, there
are differences. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, if we're going to teach a non-CS teacher the CS content, beyond
the challenge of giving them the necessary depth and breadth of
content knowledge we have to teach them how to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've inventoried some of the techniques my colleagues and I have used
in our classes and the collected methods could easily fill a couple of
graduate education courses. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what's the answer to the question? It doesn't matter where you
start but if we want to do right by our kids we need to prepare them
in not two but three areas:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS Content
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS Pedagogy
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General education and pedagogy
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Short term PD (professional development) won't do it and neither will
scripts for "teachers" to follow. It's going to take time, will, and
effort.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's hoping that municipalities look at the long game. It's fine to
do PD now to get something started but it's not enough. I wanted my
kids math teachers to know math and how to teach it. We should demand
no less from our CS teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>education</category><category>policy</category><category>teaching</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teacher-to-cs-or-cs-to-teacher/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 20:39:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Retaining Teachers</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in February, I shared my thoughts on &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry"&gt;losing CS teachers to the
tech industy&lt;/a&gt;. TL;DR - I don't think it will be a CS Ed problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers
but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good
teachers in general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of reasons why it's harder to become a
career teacher but I don't want to talk about those today. There are
also plenty of powerful forces working to destroy public schools and
teaching as a career but this post isn't about that either.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post is my attempt to tell people what teachers are actually
looking for. Some people assert that merit pay or similar "real world"
incentives will keep good teachers teaching but teachers are a
different breed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I can't speak for all teachers but I can talk about myself
and teachers I've known and worked with over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never thought I'd be a teacher, it was just something I tried when I
was dissatisfied with Wall Street. I tried it, it stuck. I didn't feel
at the time that teaching was my calling but somehow or other, I made
a career of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start, schools are not factories, companies, stores, or any other
type of business. Teachers spend most of their days with students and
little time with each other. Most of their time is allocated for
them. A high school teacher in NY will likely teach 5 class of 34 kids
each, have 1 period for lunch, 1 for preparation and 1 assigned to
some school task. You probably won't see your supervisor much. Mostly
at monthly meetings and when they observe you. Observations are
ostensibly for teacher evaluation and improvement but the system is
does neither well. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers also don't have the same types of career paths as a other
professionals do. If you want to remain a classroom teacher, there is
no career path. You could become an assistant principal or principal
but those opportunities take you away from the kids and from your
subject area. They say teaching is a calling and for career classroom
teachers it probably is. For those who spent a few years in a
classroom and left for what they see as greener pastures, maybe not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So instead teachers make a career by honing their craft, creating electives,
working with clubs and teams, or doing something similar that doesn't
remove them from the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In my case, I developed some electives and one thing led to another
and I ended up where I am today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The career situation of the teacher is why things like merit pay never
work. As a teacher, I want, in fact need my colleagues to do well. I
might have your kids next year and if you do a poor job I'll end up
suffering with the results. Sure, I'd like to be recognized as one of
the better teachers but it's not healthy for my students, my school,
or my career if I'm pitted against my fellow teacher. We're all in
this together. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do accept merit pay when it's forced on them though. As a
friend of mine once said - it's like the teacher lottery - the way
they assign the merit bonuses are based on those bogus state exams so
the distribution is pretty random, one year I'll get it, another year
someone else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that teachers couldn't use a higher salary but even
then, teachers are not driven by the same motivations as business
people. I don't know of any teacher who feels that they'd work harder
for more pay or that they work any less hard if they're paid less.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers work and fight for their kids because that's what we
do. Right before I left Stuy for Hunter, the teachers and city agreed
to a new contract. All of a sudden I got a pay raise. I can tell you
that I was neither a better or worse of a teacher the day after the
contract went into affect than the day before.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My mentor and friend &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich.html"&gt;Richard Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; talked to me about the deal we
make with society as teachers early in my career. He said, once you
get a few years in and have some seniority you're pretty secure and
you're only worry has to be teaching. We don't do great in the good
times but we do OK. On the other hand, we still have jobs in the bad
times although, again, we don't do great. We put in a lifetime of
service knowing that we won't get any significant financial reward but
at the end of the day between our contributions and the city/state's
investments we'll get a pension and won't be out in the cold in our
retirement. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The point is that those of us meant to be teachers were never looking
for the fast track to the upper class. We work to make a difference
and want society to enable us to make that difference. Teachers don't
have to be paid like they are in "the real world" but they do need to
put a roof over their heads, send their kids to college and have a
vacation now and again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not too much to ask but in this day and age it's apparently too
much to give.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>education</category><category>policy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/on-retaining-teachers/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 15:35:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mayoral Control - only when your guy's the mayor</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/mayoral-control/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral
Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were
controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a
chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as
well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in
the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I
was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system
didn't work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In 2002, everything changed with Mayoral control under Michael
Bloomberg. Under mayoral control, the mayor appoints the chancellor
who appoints superintendents an on down the line. This was supposed to
create a chain of accountability leading up to and including the
mayor. To address concerns that parents voices would be heard, we had
the Panel for Educational Policy or PEP which was supposed to vet and
vote on policy and initiatives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it was all a farce. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Parents may or may not have had a voice under the old system but they
certainly didn't have a voice with mayoral control. The majority of
members of the panel were mayoral appointees and if they didn't vote
100% in line with their masters wishes, they were removed for someone
who would. Schools were closed and initiatives were passed that were
wildly unpopular with parents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What did we get under mayoral control? There was some good, but we
also got: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% buy in to the pet education theories of non-educators like Bill
gates.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School leaders who barely taught and had little experience as
educators. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destruction of neighborhood schools 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destruction of just about all of the large comprehensive high schools
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open doors for private charter schools that follow questionable
practices.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flawed (at best)  school and teacher evaluation models 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ATR pool 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, reformers - those out to privatize education loved mayoral
control under Bloomberg. It destabilized teaching as a career
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Did results improve?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some would say yes but it's debatable. Graduation rates and test
scores are controlled by the politicians. When you have tests made,
graded, and curved in secret (except for those charter schools that
are exempt or grade their own tests), you've got to question any gains
or losses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bloomberg's failing was (and possibly still is) that he and his
appointees didn't understand education or teachers. Education not a
business and can't be treated the same way.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Did this help with accountability? To quote Mr. Bloomberg: "They can
boo me at parades." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to the de Blasio administration. Personally, I was not a
fan of Bloomberg's educational policy and I also feel that de Blasio's
also doing a poor job. Regardless of my opinion, Mayoral control under
de Blasio has certainly felt more community friendly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This hasn't sat well with the reformers upstate and while Michael
Bloomberg was granted mayoral control for his entire term, Bill de
Blasio has had to fight for it every year and every year control has
come with strings attached â€“ generally involving the flow of money
into private charter schools - still with questionable practices and
results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that many of those saying mayoral control was bad
during the Bloomberg era say it's a necessity now  and many against it
under Bloomberg are fans under de Blasio.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's even funnier, in a tragic way is that it isn't really even
control. So much is really controlled in Albany under Governor
Cuomo. When de Blasio wanted to charge private charters for space
(rightfully so, in my opinion), Albany stepped in and gave the
charters a free pass. How is that mayoral control?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of your political leanings, it's pretty clear that mayoral
control is only a good thing when the mayor is your guy. We need
something brand new that supports our communities. I was at the
&lt;a href="https://personaldemocracy.com/conference"&gt;Personal Democracy Forum 2017&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and a recurring
theme, one which we really need now for our schools is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;build with, not for&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we don't get there we'll be stuck booing our politicians at parades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Tomorrow morning I fly out to Seattle for SIGCSE 2017. For those of
you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for
Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've wanted to go for years but have never been able. It's hard for a
high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in
places with a school calendar similar to New York. NY city schools are
already closed for a week in February and then Spring Break is right
around the corner. If you're teaching an AP course with the exam in
early May, losing a week in March is really not an option. Even if you
can take the time, you'll probably have to foot the bill out of
pocket. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that I'm at Hunter, I've got more flexibility in terms of schedule
and attending is probably even more important given my current roles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm looking forward to the talks and events but probably even more
looking forward to seeing old friends, meeting new ones and seeing
face to face friends that til now I've only known through the web.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On Saturday I'll be part of a panel (thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;) titled "Tools we
can't live without." I'll probably talk about the way I use git and
GitHub and how I get my students up to speed but there are lots of
tools I can talk about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I plan to write up a series of posts on how I use GitHub (and how it
evolved from other versioning systems) as well as thoughts about other
tools I've used and some I've struggled with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you're going to be at SIGCSE drop me a line, I'd love to connect.

&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we properly prepare CS teachers, won't they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hear that a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
"training" - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They're wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don't get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that's because &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;many young teachers leave the profession&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's much harder than everyone thinks it is
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low pay
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of respect
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overworked
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of autonomy
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being scapegoated for poverty
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's become about testing, not teaching
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, "we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don't
have outside options" rather than "let's make teaching a desirable
profession to be in."  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It's typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teacher don't become teachers to
get rich or to do better than the other guy â€“ I know I didn't. We
enter it to do good - to uplift the have nots. This is why business
models like stack ranking and bonus or merit pay just don't work. A
school is a team and we're all in it together. Our job is to take care
of our kids, not to be better than that other guy. We wish we had more
time to work together and to improve things for our entire population.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back to computer science.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren't meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn't
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them. Besides, all teachers in all
subject areas could work their way into an entry level tech job via a
summer coding boot camp.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it's true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and
candidates typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it's difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we'll lose some, but we'll
keep the ones we're supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we'll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a nation, we're moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let's not let CS Education go the way of
all ed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I've been planning to put together a response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;'s
recent post - &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html"&gt;Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before getting to "does it matter," I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent &lt;a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc"&gt;IOI results&lt;/a&gt; and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we're doing fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country's producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don't encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, I've known some very smart and talented individuals
who've excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I've known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn't call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they're not the ones
who've gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they're not necessarily the ones who've
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they're only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock's laws of startups - &lt;a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team"&gt;law 9&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team"&gt;
&lt;img width="30%" src="http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like &lt;a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/"&gt;Dream it. Code it. Win it.&lt;/a&gt;, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They'll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I'd love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I'd also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also think there's a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm working on building Hunter College's honors CS program and while I
can't move the Hunter curriculum, I'm seeking that balance in my own
way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will we get there? I don't know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we'll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we'll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn't be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won't do much, however for the
rest of the students. I'm not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there's a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don't seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won't become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon. 
&lt;/p&gt;

are but probably a smaller percent from that group than from the
general pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy's intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don't recommend it in many
cases.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme certainly isn't mainstream. That's not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It's less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I've had a student with a background in Scheme, they've been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I like scheme because it's simple. It looks different than other
languages but is &lt;code&gt;(+ 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; really that different than &lt;code&gt;add(3,4)&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;3+4&lt;/code&gt;? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We can tell kids "everything's a function." While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn't, it's close enough for our
purposes. Everything's a function and the way we write a function is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Apply function &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on arguments &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;b c â€¦&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. So we have &lt;code&gt;(+ 2 3)&lt;/code&gt; to
add 2 and 3, &lt;code&gt;(and a b)&lt;/code&gt; for logical and &lt;code&gt;(= 3 4)&lt;/code&gt; to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In scheme, it would be:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though we're fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;(lambda (a b) (+ a b))&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that adds &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; associates it with the identifier &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;add2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Now we
can use the function: &lt;code&gt;(add2 5 10)&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates to 15.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it's off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course this wouldn't work had DrScheme (now &lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn't as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with &lt;a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/"&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It also didn't hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don't get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where &lt;a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/"&gt;Bootstrapworld&lt;/a&gt;
is a terrific program).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, if you're a high school CS teacher and  haven't played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of "why don't you start them with Javascript?" 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I'd get similar pushback but then it
was "why not Java?", "why not C?", or "whu not C++?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don't like Javascript as a first language and I thought I'd share some
of them here. I'll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start, let me say that I &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubiquity and availability:

&lt;p&gt;
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it's also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like &lt;a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"&gt;JSFiddle&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Interactivity:

&lt;p&gt;
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's mainstream
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's quick to get up and running
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like &lt;a href="http://www.drjava.org/"&gt;DrJava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/"&gt;DrPython&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="https://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven't found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There's no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;
which is pretty conventional, but then there's also &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 50 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//50&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  56&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'53'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '533'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

it's a riot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript's got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it's easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the fact that Javascript's a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who've at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
"everyone knows this but me." A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It's just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
