&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge428d07"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really didn't know what to expect at the &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159471"&gt;Creativity, Customization,
and Ownership: Game Design in Bootstrap: Algebra&lt;/a&gt; session. I've been a
big fan of &lt;a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/"&gt;Bootstrep&lt;/a&gt; for years and looking at the authors, &lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/10/cs-teacher-interview-emmanuel.html"&gt;Emmanuel
Schanzer&lt;/a&gt;'s been a freind forever. I've never met &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi"&gt;Shriram Krishnamurthi&lt;/a&gt;
in person but am looking forward to it. We've traded emails and blog
comments. I'd like to consider him a friend and I certainly respect
him and his work even though we frequently disagree around the
edges. The third author and presenter, Kathi Fisler was new to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Bootstrap program is embedded in algebra classes. In it, students
use Racket (nee scheme) to reinforce math skills while building
computer science skills. The big student project is a graphical game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When designing the project, students are asked to decide on and find
four resources:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enemy image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students are given a short amount of time to decide on and find these
four images. I think it was about ten minutes and that's it. That's
all the "creativity" in the assignment. After that, all the students
are essentially creating the same game with different skins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This design makes sense. You can't have students going all over the
place. Constraining the assignment in this way allows teachers who
might now be strong in computer science to guide the kids through the
program to completion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the time I was thinking: I really like all of this but is it really
open ended creativity and discovery with respect to math or computer
science? As it turned out, Fisler addressed this point at the end of
the talk in a way that made me vary happy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fisler went on to describe the rest of the student experience and then
went on to talk about the statistics they gathered. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One big takeaway was that while all the students were essentially
writing the same game varying only the graphical elements, this
encouraged students to create very different themes. They also created
rich stories around their games. The project might not have been
"creative" with respect to the CS or Math directions but it was certainly
creative in other important areas. The other takeaway was that
survey's indicated all sorts of positives from the program as a whole
so the project didn't seem to have suffered by having the students
essentially write the same program. Participants were proud of their
work, they felt their games were different from their peers and in
general the experience was good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During questions, someone asked about adding a fifth element - a
projectile or missile. It turns out that at one point the program had a
projectile component but that led to the vast majority of projects to
be themed in very similar ways. Even though not the same, it reminded me to something Randy
Pausch said in his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo"&gt;Last Lecture&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You make whatever you want. Two rules: no shooting violence and no
pornography. Not because I’m opposed to those in particular, but you know, that’s been done with
VR, right? [laughter] And you’d be amazed how many 19-year-old boys are completely out of ideas
when you take those off the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the very end, Fisler addressed my questions about creativity and
discovery. She posed these questions of her own: "Do we overstate the
case for creativity?" and "Is pure constructivism a win?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've ranted on contructivism before. It can be great but a
constructivist lesson takes a knowledgeable educator and a lot of time,
preparation, and effort. It's a big ask for, say, a high school
teacher who's already taking home hours of work every evening. Too
often I've seen the following "contructivist" model instead:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an isntructor that doesn't know their craft, the content, or
niether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the kids play with stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show off the couple of autodidacts that figure it out as success
stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'll rant more about this "model" with respect to the new buzz word
"lead learner" at some point in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the creativity side, it's important but there are also times for
the instructor to lead and for guidelines to be followed.
We want to foster creativity but that doesn't mean that it's 100%
creativity 100% of the time. Education is like life, a balance. The
Bootstrap program had to constrain the CS and math learning but
allowed for creativity in other areas. It's smart and it's a win.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I still want to meet Shriram in person one day and now also Kathi
Fisler. I didn't know what to expect walking in but I left the talk
reminded of why I'm such a fan of Emmanuel, his team, and their work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org9ede4c6"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9ede4c6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wasn't going to go to this session. I started out in a panel on
integrating social good into CS Ed. With the panel not meeting my
expectations I moved over to my second choice - the system programming
sessions where I saw &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159597"&gt;Implementing Malloc: Students and Systems
Programming&lt;/a&gt;, a paper presented by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bpr/"&gt;Brian Railing&lt;/a&gt; of CMU.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I really liked both the paper and the talk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
CMU computer science students all take a systems course that uses
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3/dp/9332573905/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=Y5ZKG2V8ZYZZPZHQP8SQ"&gt;Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great book. I
read through the first edition years ago and felt it was great
resource not only in a systems course but also for self study. One of
the labs has the students implement their own memory allocation calls,
or &lt;b&gt;malloc&lt;/b&gt; for us old time C wonks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were a number of self perceived  deficiencies with the
assignment such as encouraging bad programming style by modeling
less than ideal practices but the biggest deficiency as that students
could game the assignment. Students could do very well on the
assignment by exploiting knowledge of the assignment rather than by
writing a full and correct malloc implementation. One example is that
students were able to figure out that no allocation would be more than
100MB so they really didn't have to deal with 64 bit pointers. They
could use smaller offsets thus simplifying the assignment. The
assignment became more about figuring out how to get it through the
grader and less about learning memory management. I'm sure I'm
overstating it but that's the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Railing explained all of the deficiencies and then how they changed
the assignment to address them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, the assignment had fewer loopholes to game so
students had to really write the malloc library and presumably learn
about memory management.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They also added an intermediate deliverable so students couldn't leave
everything for the last minute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Near the end of the talk, Railing discussed results where he pointed
out that students final exam scores didn't change but they did better
on the malloc questions. It wasn't clear if the overall scores didn't
change, meaning that the students did better on the malloc questions
but worse somewhere else or if they did similarly to past students on
the other sections and in addition they scored better on the malloc
questions. I'm not sold on the final exam questions being the best way
to evaluate learning but it is an easy data point. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I loved the presentation and paper and I love what Railing is doing
but my big takeaway was…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, Duh…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;students aren't doing as they should&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teacher realizes students are gaming assignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teacher reworks assignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;students do better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers do this all the time. Of course when we do it, it's not
"research." This was a recurring theme for me at SIGCSE2018 and I
tweeted it. While it's true that K12 teachers can learn a lot about CS
content from higher ed, people in higher ed can learn a lot about
teaching from teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What Railing presented was terrific and important as changing
assignments like this will now be considered by people who haven't
thought about this before but this is second nature to a teacher. Of
course I'm talking about a good teacher, not one who blindly follows
scripted lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't mean this as a slight to professors. They're hired and
promoted based on research so much of their job involves another skill
set. I know many professors who care very much about teaching but they
might only teach one or two classes a semester that meets once or
twice a week while a typical high school teacher meets 150 students a
day five days a week over five different classes a day.  Much more of
an opportunity for deliberate practice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This presents a huge challenge. How can professors who are hired and
promoted as researchers be given the time and ability to develop as
teachers? What about adjuncts or Teaching Assistants? I'd imagine it's
even harder for them. I know that colleges have lines for teaching
faculty but from what I can see, those instructors are usually super
overloaded with classes and students so that doesn't solve the
problem. Even if you do have teaching faculty that have the time to
develop their craft, how do you get those teaching chops over to the
research faculty?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the session, I was talking about this with &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjs/"&gt;Mark Stehlik&lt;/a&gt;,
Assistant Dean at CMU's School of Computer Science. Mark was telling
me about CMU's efforts to develop teaching faculty across the
disciplines. I was happy to hear about the efforts CMU was taking but
it sounds like they have the same challenges with respect to pedagogy
as everyone else. If it's a challenge for CMU with all their
resources, what does that mean for the rest of us?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Still, it was encouraging to go to a number of sessions where it was
clear that professors - both teaching and research faculty are serious
about the craft of teaching and conferences like SIGCSE can bring them
together with those of us who don't have the chops as researchers but
do so as teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org7ab1556"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7ab1556"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been having fun with this years &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; competition. So
far, I've been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I'll be traveling for the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/"&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there's a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it's computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That's true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:

&lt;h2 id="org34a4687"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org34a4687"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial"&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about Stanford possibly &lt;a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/04/21/cs-department-updates-introductory-courses-java-is-gone/"&gt;moving away
from Java&lt;/a&gt; as their intro language. This comes on the heels of a
semi-regular thread on one of the lists I'm on asking about what
languages are used at assorted colleges around the country. Invariably
the Pascal -&amp;gt; C++ -&amp;gt; Java progression of APCS turns up in these
threads.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are plenty of arguments to be made both for and against pretty
much any language or platform. There's no single best universal
answer. Each choice giveth and each choice taketh away. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I'm really curious about is who's looking at intro languages in
the context of complete programs or even complete educations that
could span multiple institutions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Early language choices can make a big difference in engaging and
exciting newcomers but there are ramifications later on that few seem
to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Take the APCS change from C++ to Java. It removed memory management
from the first year course. It also simplified issues relating to
pass by value vs pass by reference (or, rather, passing address by
value), bought much more strongly into OOP and moved more towards
using built in implementations of data structures like Lists rather
than rolling your own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Removing memory management from the first year course in and of itself
isn't a problem as long as it's taught and taught effectively
somewhere later on. It could be argued that "memory is already covered
in our required systems course." That could be the case, but there are
many concepts that kids don't get the first time around. Is an
institution that covered memory management in CS1/2 and then came back
to it in a later Systems course giving their students the same
understanding now that they've eliminated the CS1/2 experience? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What about OOP buy in. Personally, I've never been a big OOP fan but
that's neither here nor there. What I have found is that depending on
how a student is exposed to programming in CS1/CS2 can have a big
influence on how they approach problems later. Did the move to Java
cause more of our students to try to use shoehorn OOP into a problem
that really shouldn't be approached in an OOP manner?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suspect that the use of built in data structures has had a
negative impact. A few years after the switch to Java, I was talking
to a senior tech worker. He was having a bad day - interviewing
potential internees and full time engineers. My friend was complaining
that the kids couldn't come up with solutions to what he thought were
pretty straightforward questions. He felt that had the kids actually
implemented algorithms like the nlogn sorts rather than just learning
java .sort method and just talking about the algorithm they'd be
better prepared. I've heard this sentiment repeated over and over
throughout the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that Java is a horrible language or horrible for
teaching - that's another debate. The point is that you can't just
look at the intro class and who it draws in. You have to consider how
it will prepare students for the next level and you have to look at
the big picture – will our students get everything they need by the
time they leave us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many schools have moved to Python. Will that effect students take on
type systems later on? Will the flexibility and constructs like list
comprehensions make it harder to teach recursion since there are
"easier" ways to do it? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None of these are really problems so long as the CS1/2 (or even CS0)
isn't taught in a vacuum. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I fear, however that too often we're paying attention to the intake of
the pipe and not so much the output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cs</category><category>langauges</category><category>pedagogy</category><guid>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/first-language-changing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:46:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GitHub as a tool for education</title><link>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/</link><dc:creator>Mike Zamansky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
When I started using git and GitHub with my students it was a natural
progression having started with started with CVS and then, as
technology changed moving through Subversion and then Mercurial. It
was all about using sensible professional software development
techniques while making it easier for students to submit work and for
me to evaluate their submissions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over time, I found that git and GitHub in fact provided some extra
support for educators right out of the box.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In my &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-3"&gt;last github post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about using the results of &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt;
and looking at diffs. Both provide ways of seeing what a student did
and when. The commit log and history make it easier to hold students accountable to working
through a project and not leavings for the last minute. The diffs make
it easier to see what's changed both to see progress and also to help
support students as they develop their projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you use Emacs, as I do, you can use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine"&gt;git timemachine&lt;/a&gt; package
which does a great job visualizing changes:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/sigcse-github/timemachine.gif" alt="timemachine.gif" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Other editors might have a similar feature.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The contribution graphs also provide a quick snapshot which shows what
team members are contributing and when:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph.png" alt="githubgraph.png" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The punchcard graph is also useful to see when students actually do
their work.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/sigcse-github/githubgraph2.png" alt="githubgraph2.png" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
GitHub also make it easy to set up starter code or to have students
"take over" each others projects by forking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm very happy using git and GitHub as is but if you want more
support, check out &lt;a href="https://classroom.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt;. Had it existed when I started,
I'd probably have used it but since I had already gotten used to my
work flows I've stuck with raw git and github.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In case you missed the earlier posts describing the process I use to
introduce github to my classes here they are:

least interesting.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67e08c4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial"&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt; wrote about the woes of &lt;a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/the-need-for-better-software-and-systems-to-support-active-cs-learning/%0A"&gt;using clickers&lt;/a&gt; in a
class. The amount of effort required to use his school's approved
clicker technology sounds ridiculous so while we need tools to better
engage students in large class settings we need better tools that can
be integrated into our classes more easily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've never used clickers. On top of stories like Mark's, there are  a
number of problems with using clickers in a public school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can't force students to buy them and in NYC, until recently,
students couldn't use their phones (which they also might not have).
Forgetting the expense, if the school provides them, is it one per
student? If so, who's going to administer the clicker to student
mapping and how will that be communicated to the teachers. If college
tech infrastructures are sometimes lacking, high schools are orders of
magnitudes worse. The resources just aren't there. Then we have to
deal with loss and breakage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If a teacher somehow gets a class set of clickers, they have to deal
with mapping clickers to students for all of their classes and make
sure the right student has the right clicker. Again, loss  and
breakage is a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then you have to create the question content and hope that everything
works in class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The value added given the overhead just doesn't seem worth it
particularly since high school classes, while large, are not in the
hundreds and there are other methods of student engagement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's what I use instead. It's not perfect but it's low cost and low
effort with a pretty high return.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic configuration, is a simple three state broadcast device.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not without its problems and I don't think it would work as well
in a large lecture but given the cost, it's well worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what is it?
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/thumbs/fonzup.jpg" alt="fonzup.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Thumbs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org7b082ed" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org7b082ed"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7b082ed"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Periodically, I'll poll my class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
&lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/thumbs/sidethumb.png"&gt;
&lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/thumbs/upthumb.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img width="30%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/thumbs/downthumb.jpg"&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Thumb to the side? Everything's OK. Keep going as you're going. I get
it. Basically, things are good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thumb up? Speed up, you're going too slow, I got it five minutes ago or
some similar big positive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thumb down? I have no idea what you're talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's cheap, easy, quick, and once you can get your class to buy in,
you can get a quick sense of the class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The downsides?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The class has to have a level of comfort so that students vote
honestly and don't just give you positive feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No data collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The upsides?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cheap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works on any topic on the fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even if the votes are artificially skewed towards positive, it does
forces the class to be at least a little attentive and to engage in
some physical response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can get analog responses by allowing students to adjust wrist
rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to the redundancy? I've never had a kid leave their thumb at home
or lose it and even if they did, they've got a second hand.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/thumbs/fonztwo.jpg" alt="fonztwo.jpg" align="center" height="200"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This also works in extreme environments. Try using a clicker or mobile
app with gloves or mittens on or underwater.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't teach large lectures so I don't know how this would work in a
huge class. I'd imagine it's still worth it given that it's so low
friction and low cost of entry even if it's not perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Today we're looking at &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; 2016 &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2"&gt;number 2&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To change things up, I thought I'd do a video where I live code a solution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The solution I present is pretty straightforward - use a 2D array (or
technically, an array of strings) to represent the keypad, parse the
input, and follow the input instructions to build the code. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I really like about Advent of Code is that every
problem has two parts and depending on how you solved part 1, you may
or may not have extra work to do for part 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago, I wrote about one of the coding techniques I
try to convey to my students. The idea of &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md"&gt;changing the data&lt;/a&gt; to take
away edge and special cases. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part two of this problem is a perfect time to use that technique.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the video, I hope you enjoy it:
&lt;/p&gt;

I recently &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-of-code-2016/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; - a series of programming
problems relseased one a day. While they vary in terms of level of
difficulty, a number of them make nice problems for introductory to
mid level programming classes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on a few of them starting with
the first problem from this years competition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1"&gt;Take a minute to read it over.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At first glance, it might seem to a young programmer that this problem
requires a two dimensional array - all about (x,y) coordinates but
then there's a problem - there are no limits on coordinates and we
can't make an unlimited size array.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After thinking a bit, hopefully the programmer realizes that all they
need to do is keep track of the how the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(x,y)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; location changes over
time. In the solution below, we start at &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(0,0)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and count the steps as
we update two variables &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When we finish processing the moves, we have our current location in
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(x,y)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and we have the number of steps taken to get there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The solution below hsa a couple of niceties that a beginning
programmer might not know or use (and I'm not arguing that what's written is
superior in any way, it's just what I ended up writing).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I make use of tuple destructuring:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
which assigns &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the first item in the tuple and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the
second. I used that a number of times 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also use a list  I call &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;dirs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to hold dx and dy values for the
four direcitons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This made it easier to to update the location based on the 4
directions. I could also have just used if statements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's all the code:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# assume our starting location is 0,0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# we start with d=0 -&amp;gt; facing north&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# as we turn left or right, we can just increment or decrement d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and dirs[d] will give us the appropriate dx and dy to update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# our locatoin for the next step&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is only needed for part 2  - We track visited locations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# by adding them to the dictionary. If we try to add a location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# that's already been visited we know that we've found our final &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# locs={}  # uncomment this line for part 2&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the first char in i is the direction to turn in (L or R)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the rest represents the number of steps.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:])&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"L"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;totalsteps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Uncomment this block for part 2&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# each time we have a new location, see if it's already in&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# locs, if it isn't, add it.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if it is, we're visiting somewhere twice so we're done.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#if ((x,y) not in locs):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    locs[(x,y)]=1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#else:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    print((x,y))&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    print(abs(x)+abs(y)) # the answer&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    sys.exit(0)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#    break&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Overall, a nice little problem for beginning and intermediate
students.

&lt;h2 id="org947b0d7"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org947b0d7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We're now a week in to my first class at Hunter. It's a little early
for me to really compare and contrast the high school to college
experience but I thought I'd share some thoughts on a tool that I've
recently started to play with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My students were all supposed to be issued laptops at the beginning of
the semester. The plan was to have them learn Linux, the command line,
and a little DevOps along the way. I guess I shouldn't have been too
surprised to learn that the laptops weren't going to come in until
late September.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scratch all that advance lesson planning. A brief scramble and I was
able to relocate the class into a computer lab but now we can't
customize the kids environments. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Time to look for an online solution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're starting the kids off in Python, a choice that I'll talk about
in some future post and normally my online go to for Python is
&lt;a href="http://codesters.com"&gt;codesters.com&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a big fan of the codesters team and product. This
time, though, I decided to try something else. Specifically &lt;a href="http://repl.it"&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;. Partly because, as with
codesters, I like the people behind it. It's also pretty simple and it
supports a lot of different languages:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
APL, ES2015 ,Bloop, BrainF, C, CoffeeScript, C++, C++11, C#, Emoticon,
Forth, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, LOLCODE, Lua, Nodejs, PHP, Python,
Python3, QBasic, Roy, Ruby, Rust, Scheme, Swift, Unlambda, and HTML, CSS, JS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's still a pretty new product so there are occasional hiccups but
I'm really liking things so far. Some of the things I like include:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a simple clean interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing and embedding code:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;script src="//repl.it/embed/DF3m/19.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project mode which allows multi file projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examples to get you started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But the thing I'm really liking are the teacher features they're
working on. The teacher interface isn't fancy. I like that. Things are
simple and clean and they let me get the job done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had two extra minutes in class yesterday and in that time, I was
able to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a classroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite all my students by email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create 2 quick assignments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The assignment page lets you give starter code as well as instructions
and it also lets you put in tests that are run when a student submits
their work for instant feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I really like the tests feature on projects. So far, I've only played
with Python unit tests. Repl.it uses a really easy to follow
interface and has a sample test to guide you. There's also an option
for input/output matching which includes flexible matching and regular
expressions but I haven't played with it yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I'm liking this tool. When the kids get their laptops we'll
probably use it somewhat less as they start to learn to use their own
systems but I'm glad to have repl.it in my teaching arsenal.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org337d3ec"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent last Saturday up at the Microsoft offices in Times Square
observing a &lt;a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/"&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; training session. My fried &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielgranor"&gt;Nathaniel Granor&lt;/a&gt;, Teals
Regional Manager in the east has invited me a number of times and this
time I was able to make it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you don't know, TEALS is a program that takes volunteers in the
tech industry and places them in classrooms. Unlike other programs,
the TEALS volunteers work with the teachers while the kids learn some
CS. The idea is that the teacher will learn about CS from the
volunteer and the volunteer will learn something about teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not the same as having a strong, knowledgeable CS teacher in the
classroom but until we get there, TEALS is doing great work giving
kids something that they need and otherwise wouldn't get.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At one point, Nathaniel started to talk to the volunteers about lesson
plans emphasizing the fact that TEALS would provide all the lesson materials and
the plans so these new to teaching tech volunteers wouldn't have to
make curricular decisions. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lesson plan form was pretty traditional and pretty formulaic:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;warm up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Very similar to what I was shown back in the day during my two day
"teaching boot camp" that kicked off my career &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/lesson-plans/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and very
appropriate as an effective and efficient way to prepare these
volunteers for their first days. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking about my lesson planning over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I started, I was teaching math but I wasn't really a math
guy - I was CS all the way. I had to remember the math from high
school, learn the new topics, and figure out how to teach it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a very supportive department but they were busy with their own
classes and this was pre internet. Fortunately, the NYC DOE published
lesson plan books. They were basically bound volumes of xerox copies
of hand written and typed lesson plans provided by experienced
teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I spent many hours copying them, studying  them, and then later
tweaking them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They were a life saver back then. How was the teaching? OK. Not
great. I got the material to the kids but I was nothing special. This
is where I started to form my bias against the scripted teaching
that's being pushed down today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I developed my chops, I started to design my own experiences for my
classes and things improved. By the time I was done teaching math -
maybe 4 years in, I was just scratching the surface of being a math
teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One year in, I started teaching CS along with math at Seward
Park. When I was bumped to Stuy, I went back to math for  a year and a
half and then it was all CS all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For CS, we didn't have lesson plan books so I had to craft everything
from scratch. It was a lot of work but the results were much better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At first, I would actually write out lesson plans a la math lesson
plans. A "do now," "instructional objectives," "applications,"
"Homework," etc. The only thing I never formally wrote out was a
"medial summary."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Over time, my lessons got better but my lesson plans looked worse and
worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were times a lesson plan might look something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/lesson-plans/plan.jpg" alt="plan.jpg" align="center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
OK, not exactly but as I developed at my craft, I didn't need a laid
out script to follow line for line  rather, just a set of little
reminders and maybe some printed out code. If we were going to develop
a complicated algorithm or derivation, though, I would still write out
all the steps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This doesn't mean that as my career progressed I planned any less. It
might appear that I'm winging it but even if little to nothing is
written down, there is a plan and there's always a lot of pre work
before class begins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, to bring this back to TEALS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's interesting how what's good in one context is not so much in
another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What TEALS is doing is great - they've got to get a lot of
technologists in to classrooms quickly but once there, they'll be with
real, hopefully experienced teachers. What they're doing gets them
ready to go. It's a starting point, not an end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, when I see scripted curriculum being sold as the
special sauce, be it in CS teacher "training," Teach for America
summer prep or in the name of charter school uniformity, I run the
other way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's prepare curricular  materials for important programs like TEALS
and for beginning teachers just starting out but let's not confuse a
scripted lesson that can be delivered by one and all to be anything
close to the work of a master educator and craftsman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

came in to teaching with zero education credentials and took the
minimum number of ed classes for my license after I started.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
