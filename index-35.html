I usually don't do year in review posts. At Stuy, not much changed
year after year so I never felt it worth summarizing the past and
projecting the future. At Hunter, now that I'm a couple of years in,
projects are really picking up steam so I think it's worth talking
about them.
</p>

<p>
One of my two major missions at Hunter was to build a CS Honors
program and raise the profile of Hunter's undergraduate CS program in
general. Hunter had a strong CS program before I joined the team it's
just that few people knew about it.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to see Hunter become the "go to" institution for
undergraduate CS in New York City before my time is done.
</p>

<p>
This is an extremely important mission. 
</p>

<p>
There are other strong CS options besides Hunter but compare the costs:

<b><b>Hunter is about one tenth the cost.</b></b>
</p>

<p>
True, if you're wealthy this isn't a problem and if you're at the
bottom of the economic ladder you might get a full ride but if you
fall into that category where you earn more than the financial aid
people think is "poor" but are clearly not rich you're left in a bad place. This seems
particularly true for New Yorkers as our income seems higher than that
of people from other parts of the country but our cost of living is
higher as well.
</p>

<p>
My wife and I are both career public educators. No one would confuse a
family of two working teachers as upper class but we were granted no
financial aid for our kids. The alternatives without a great public
option are to have saved for our entire lives and now liquidate those
savings or go into tremendous debt.
</p>

<p>
This alone makes the mission critical. Add to that the accessibility
issue - elite private institutions only have to concern themselves
with whatever slice of the population they choose to accept. We are
charged with providing a top flight education to all - be they the
high achievers, the late bloomers, the struggling students or anyone 
else.
</p>

<p>
So, what's happened in the past year?
</p>

<p>
First, the Daedalus honors program is developing nicely. In our first
year we had a cohort of 12. This past year 27. I haven't seen the
applicant pool yet - Hunter applications are open until the end of
January, but I'm hoping to bring in an even larger cohort this year. I
spent a good amount of time this fall visiting high schools to talk
about Hunter CS and CS options in general. Not as many as I'd like but
more than during year one. 
</p>

<p>
We had classes, trips, and special events but more important was that
the cohort is starting to form a community and the students want it to
be a community that includes ALL of Hunter CS, not just the honors
students.
</p>

<p>
They've started a once a week Dojo where students can work on projects
and interact and we're starting an evening speaker series in
the Spring. 
</p>

<p>
Overall there's a vibe of excitement and an energy around Hunter CS
that I've been told hasn't been there before.
</p>

<p>
In my class, I've been introducing a number of real world practices
that are usually not covered in undergraduate CS and we're starting to
talk about bringing those practices into the non-honors sections.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we've started to partner with the New York Tech
community. We're bringing together the Hunter students and the tech
professionals to raise awareness outside of Hunter of what our
students can do and to best prepare our students for their next
steps. These partnerships, in addition to internship possibilities
have led to us planning some great things this coming semester
incuding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>workshops such as how to work on an open source project or how to do
a code review.</li>
<li>Having industry mentors at our local Dojo sessions.</li>
<li>Mixer events to educate our students as to the variety of pathways
they can follow when they graduate.</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This past year set the stage but there will be some challenges moving
forward.
</p>

<p>
The biggest one is continued outreach to high schools. Getting to the
students and their parents to let them know that we have a great
program. It's also about convincing them to come to Hunter. Back in
the day CUNY was "the poor man's Harvard" but open enrollment in the
1970s killed that reputation. CUNY has been making it's way back and
Hunter has many excellent programs but reputations are decades in the
making and at Hunter CS we're just starting to get the word out.
</p>

<p>
The other big challenge will be with time. Right now, for the most
part, I'm a team of one. I have tremendous support from my colleagues
but they all have their own full time obligations and the overall
growth in Hunter CS has already put a strain on personnel and
resources.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the challenges, I'm not complaining. This has been an
exciting year for Hunter CS and an exciting year for me to be a part
of it.

I generally use three email accounts. My personal one, work one, and
one for my non-profit. For a couple of years, I've been using mu4e
under Emacs for both my work and non-profit email accounts and gmail
for my personal account. 
</p>

<p>
I've had lots of requests for a video on what I do but I've been
hesitant for two reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There are parts of my configuration that are copied from others and
I really don't understand.</li>
<li>I wasn't happy with the complexity and some of the tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>
While there are still parts of my configuration that I'm not 100%
clear on I've cleaned up the tooling and complexity by using mu4e only
for my work email for the time being and by switching to mbsync. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a writeup on configuring things with video at the end.
</p>

<p>
Unless you run an email server on your local machine using mu4e can be
thought of as three parts.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get the email from the server to the local machine using IMAP.</li>
<li>Setting up mu.</li>
<li>Access the email locally from Emacs.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga9335b9">
<p>
I found his terrific blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/robstewartUK">Rob Stewart</a> on setting up <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rs46/posts/2014-01-13-mu4e-email-client.html">mbsync and
mu4e</a>. Read it over. I basically followed his directions for setting up
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/isync/isync/ci/master/tree/">mbsync</a>. To build from source under Linux, I used the sequence:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre></div>

<p>
I followed Rob's instructions basically verbatim for the password and
authentication stuff so I suggest you do the same. 
</p>

<p>
You'll also have to make sure to make the necessary email directories
manually. I describe all of this in the video.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe8717f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbe8717f">Part 2 - setting up mu.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe8717f">
<p>
To set up mu, clone it from git://github.com/djcb/mu.git and build
it. You can find dependencies <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Installation.html">here</a> and then follow the same sequence
used to build mbsync listed above.
</p>


<p>
Since I store my local email under a folder <code>Maildir</code>  which is what
mu defaults to I can start using it by indexing my emails:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mu index
</pre></div>

<p>
The video shows some examples of using mu from the command line and
you can look at the mu cheatsheet <a href="http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/cheatsheet.html">here</a>.

<h3 id="orgbcb229f">Setting up mu4e in emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbcb229f">
<p>
Finally, you can set up mu4e in emacs. Take a look at Rob's
configuration in his post or my <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/mu4econfig-sample.el">sample</a> config. You'll have to take a
few minutes to go through either and make the appropriate changes but 
the required changes should be cleared.
</p>

<p>
The video goes through all of this and then a brief demo of how I use
mu4e.
</p>

<p>
I'm very happy with it and plan to integrate my non-profit email and
maybe even personal email into it soon.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy:

<p>
In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool. 
</p>

<p>
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.
</p>

<p>
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.
</p>

<p>
ATR's would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they're treated like second class
citizens.
</p>

<p>
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They've falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That's a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher's
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they're returned to their schools. In any
case they're not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).
</p>

<p>
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.
</p>

<p>
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn't release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he's one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn't want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that's the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.
</p>

<p>
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won't give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered "damaged goods" but also because they're expensive to
hire. 
</p>

<p>
When a school gets an ATR to them, it's free - the cost isn't added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.
</p>

<p>
A clear example of this is Stuy's  current math chair. He's an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he's either good enough for
the position or he's not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn't then what is he still doing there. I'm not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it's either one or the
other.
</p>

<p>
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it's a big lie. 
</p>

<p>
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:
</p>




<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/atr1.png" alt="atr1.png" align="center" height="250"></p>
</div>

<p>
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn't the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/atr2.png" alt="atr2.png" align="center" height="250"></p>
</div>

<p>
ALL the money comes from the DOE.
</p>

<p>
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it's really
quite simple.
</p>

<p>
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Assign the ATR to a school</li>
<li>If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep
them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR's area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.</li>
<li>If the school or ATR don't like each other the ATR gets rotated,
however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit
them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).</li>
<li>If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of
schools force the placement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it. Simple and solves the problem.

This question appeared on Facebook a few days ago:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down
a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my
students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in
subsequent parts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn't
have time then so I thought I'd write it up now.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, it took me forever to find the post again over on
Facebook. If there's a way to mark posts or save a direct link I'd
love to hear it. I had to look through all the CS Ed groups I belong
to manually until I found it again.
</p>

<p>
When I read the program I was reminded of a PD session we had to
attend back at Stuyvesant. Back then the fad was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum">Writing Across the
Curriculum</a>. Every teacher in every class was to give some significant
writing assignment, evaluate it and provide feedback. Let's forget the
fact that most of us never had any training or preparation to do so.
</p>

<p>
On that PD day the guest speaker was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser">William Zinsser</a>. The first thing
he said was that what we were being asked to do by our principal was
bunk. He then proceeded to give advice on  simple good writing.
</p>

<p>
The procedure he recommended following was to ask yourself (or have
the student ask themselves) "what does my audience need to know next?"
That's your next sentence. Then ask the question again. Rinse and
repeat until done.
</p>

<p>
It was simple and it made sense. It also applied to introductory CS
problems. When starting out, students have a limited CS / programming
tool box so a good question for them to ask when trying to solve a
problem is not only "what do I need to do next? but also "what can I
do next?" 
</p>

<p>
When students have a limited CS vocabulary and set of idioms - loops,
conditionals, functions, whatever, there will only be so many things
they can do to move a problem along. If they go through the things the
<b><b>can</b></b> do they will likely fall on to what they <b><b>should</b></b> do.
</p>

<p>
It's similar to doing a proof in geometry. Students have a set of
givens. Given that set, what can they do? They only know so many
theorems at the beginning. 
</p>

<p>
Over time, they'll recognize patterns and develop as problem solvers.
</p>

<p>
If you're part of the AP CS A teachers facebook group you probably saw
the question. Many good answers were posted. I just wanted to add this
thought to the collection.

Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.
</p>

<p>
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we'll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.
</p>

<p>
I haven't had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.</li>
<li>There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
Masters degree</li>
<li>There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
workforce</li>
<li>There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
won't have to give up tenure in their current license.</li>
<li>There will be an "individual evaluation" pathway which sounds to me
like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.</li>
<li>There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022</li>
<li>There's a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the devil is in the details. What's an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I haven't had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a <a href="http://www.uft.org/">UFT</a> representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from <a href="https://www.nysut.org/">NYSUT</a> was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I've already written on how I feel that this is a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry">red
herring</a>. What shocked me though was their feeling that "we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They're doing a great job and don't need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge." I think they're wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that's needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.
</p>

<p>
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I'll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.

I'm now well behind in <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. Traveling up to Michigan to see
my son and my brother and his family will do that.
</p>

<p>
I was planning on working to catch up but got distracted earlier by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/">this thread</a> on the Advent of Code subreddit. Specifically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">this comment</a>
by <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>, the contest creator. The thread is about the level of
difficulty of the various problems and Eric's comment talks about some
of the factors that go into creating a good collection of problems for
a contest and the difficulties involved.
</p>

<p>
It made me think of a conversation I had twenty years ago with Rob
Kolstad. We were chatting at a programming competition while the
students were hacking away. We were discussing that there were only so
many questions that a typical high school or college competition can
ask:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Mathy question</li>
<li>Recursion / divide and conquer etc.</li>
<li>Graph stuff</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
</ol>
<p>
and I think one or two more. The actual questions were just window
dressing on these fundamental question types. 
</p>

<p>
You can see this in many competitions including Advent of Code -
particularly if you look over all three years. This is not a
criticism. I love Advent of Code and think that Eric and the people
he's working with are doing a great job . Read Eric's comment to get a
deeper dive into what he thinks about as a contest designer.
</p>

<p>
I also got to thinking how similar creating a competition is to
creating an exam. Maybe that's because I'm currently writing the final
my students will take in a couple of days. In class tests are
certainly not the best of assessments but they do have their place and
in any event, they're frequently  required by school or departmental
policy.
</p>

<p>
There are many similarities between what teachers consider when making
tests to what contest designers consider. What concepts and techniques
must the students use? Are the problems too similar? Do they ramp up
in difficulty? Are they all or nothing or can a student incrementally
work their way to a solution? Does one problem lead into another? 
</p>

<p>
There's no big reveal or surprise here today. Just something I've been
thinking about. 
</p>

<p>
A couple of busy days coming up but maybe over the weekend I can get
back to Advent of Code.
