This video is all about using incremental search to navigate through your emacs buffers.

You can use the default incremental searchb, bound to **C-s** for
isearch-forward **C-r** to search backwards (reverse).

They work really well as is but I prefer using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Swiper]]. The video demos
both and the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Swiper]] home page has loads of details.

Part of the Swiper package includes ivy and counsel which I use instead of ido.

The video also mentions lorem-ipsum mode for generating text quickly and **describe-mode** in the help system.

If you want to see a nice video specifically on swiper by the author, here it is:
