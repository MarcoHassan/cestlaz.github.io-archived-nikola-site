After reading a couple of comments on my [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-code-tracing/][last post]] where I talked a
bit about practitioners vs researchers I thought I'd expand and
expound a bit.

While there are education researchers that I very much respect,
overall, I've had far too many experiences that have left me cold.


the one true way until the next one true  way

Math teachers -- doing what works vs the research

in ed school - people who haven't taught telling me how to teach

many complex factors not accounted for

best research is "I tried this you might want to try this"
