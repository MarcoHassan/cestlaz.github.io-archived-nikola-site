I stumbled across a video by [[https://twitter.com/timbaldridge?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Tim Baldridge]] this morning. I don't know
Tim - it looks like he's a developer and he's made a number of
instructional videos on Clojure. 

This video is titled "Learning a Language Takes time." 

In the video (embedded below) Tim talks about the design of a guitar
and a violin. How a guitar is "better" designed - frets make it easy
to hit correct notes, tuning pegs stay in place and you can easily
play a single note or a chord.

Contrast that to a violin. Tuning pegs have no mechanism and are held
in place by friction, notes must be precisely hit, and producing even
a single note at a time so that it sounds good is a challenge.

On the other hand, you can do some really amazing things on a violin
if you master it. 

This struck a chord with me. I once saw an interview with Itzhak
Perlman - my favorite violinist or all time (and coincidentally my
childhood violin teacher' teacher). He was comparing a violinist with
a pianist. He said that it was easy to play the correct notes in tune
on a piano and since the mechanics were simpler a musician can,
earlier in their career, start working on interpreting the music. A
violinist, on the other hand (in his opinion) can take half a lifetime
to master just from the mechanics point of view and only then can you
really start working on the music.

Perlman was talking about an album he had released - "[[https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/itzhak-perlman-concertos-from-my-childhood][Concertos from
my Childhood]]." The idea was that young violinists study a standard
repertoire of "learning concertos" and of course, since they're
beginners they never sound good. Perlman decided to record a number of
these as an adult and this album was the result.

Here's a track of Perlman playing one of those concertos that I
remember struggling through as a kid:

Of course, this is Perlman so I'm betting he sounded pretty good as a
kid:

Back to Tim's video. 

Tim talks about the idea that learning a language, much like an
instrument takes time and also that some languages do less hand
holding and are harder to learn than others. The two key points are:

1. Some times things are harder to learn because at the end of the day
   they have more power and so it's worth it.
2. Don't expect to learn something subntantial overnight.
3. With focused practice over time, you can master new hard things.

Tim's a little less sympathetic than I'd be in my classroom but that's
okay - Tim's talking about teaching developers a new language and so I
think he's view is appropriate and correct there. 

The truth is that learning does take time. You can create the illusion
of results with concentrated coaching and flashy tools but real
education takes work and time [fn::but work can indeed be fun].

A couple of years ago I was speaking to a non-teacher friend who had
just run a month long intensive "coding" summer program. They were very proud of the work
and what the kids accomplished -- "They learned so much... Their
projects were awesome." The group had a reunion some time later. I
asked how much they remembered - "pretty much nothing."

So, here's Tim's video. It's about 20 minutes but if you're pressed
for time, just up the speed of playback:
