I've been using [[https://getnikola.com/blog/][Nikola]] to generate this blog since April 2016 -
shortly after I started at Hunter. Prior to that I used [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] for  a
bunch of that and it all started out as a Google Blogger blog.

I moved from Blogger to Jekyll because I wanted to control my content
and also because I wanted to user Markdown. Later I started using
[[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] markdown for not only my blog but also for tons of other
things. Jekyll became a problem for me because I'm not a Ruby guy I
had issues maintaining Ruby ecosystem installs across all my
machines. Next came Nikola. It was easier for me to maintain because
it's written in Python but even so I've had some issues recently. Not
with Nikola but with other libraries. While I like Nikola I figured
this was a sign and it was time to learn something new.

This time, I'm going to try [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] written in [[https://golang.org/%0A][Go]]. It has native support
for Org-mode  and overall looks pretty spiffy.

I'll shift over in a couple of days.

If you're a regular reader and you don't see a new post within a week
it would be a real help of you would let me know. Everything should
transision smoothly but you never know.

Thanks!!!!
