I haven't been teaching this past semester. That's why I haven't been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.

It's also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.

One issue that keeps coming up is cheating. 

Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend [[https://twitter.com/cscheerleader][Ria]] recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it's locked in the Facebook silo. I've got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let's focus on project
cheating. Something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.

One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. [[https://twitter.com/alfredtwo][Alfred]] wrote a bit about it on his blog [[http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html][here]] where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.

I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
