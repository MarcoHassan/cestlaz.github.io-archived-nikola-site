At the time, I thought it was a bogus question. First day of a
graduate class for aspiring school supervisors, the professor asks
"What do you teach?" We all answered. "Math," "History," "English,"
etc.. At the end, the professor pointed out that "none of you said
that you taught children."

I thought it was bogus because we were a room full of teachers. We all
taught students. What differentiated us was subject matter and grade
level. 

Looking back, maybe it wasn't a bad question. Many teachers are
subject first, student second. I don't mean that they're all about the
subject  and don't care about their students. Rather, that their view 
is through the context of the subject. They fail to see the big
picture. The whole child and the entire educational picture.

Why do I bring this up? Over concerns about the direction CS Ed is
moving in.
