A few days ago, I saw a [[https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process%0A][piece]] on [[https://twitter.com/dhh][David Heinemeier Hansson's]] tweet on
whiteboard interviews:

I'm not a huge fan of the whiteboard interview but I found the tweets
in general to miss the point. Most of the whiteboard interviews I'm
aware of involve algorithmic problem solving while the tweets, at
least the ones I've seen all refer to things that indeed one would
look up and, at least to my knowledge aren't typically asked about in
whiteboard interviews.

Tim Bray takes that point of view in a [[https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/03/04/Whiteboard-Interviews][recent post]].

The idea isn't all bad. The interviewer has an opportunity to see how
the candidate thinks and works through a problem and in an ideal
situation the interviewer is, at least to a point, coaching the
candidate to help them through the process.

On the other hand, whiteboard interviews can be very stressful and I'd
imagine skew towards candidates who work well in isolation in a short
period of time, have a good amount of exposure to these types of
algorithmic problems and yes, have practiced and trained specifically
for the interview. On top of that, an interviewer isn't necessarily
good at bringing out the best from a candidate.

Once a candidate has accepted a position, they'll likely be working
with a team, with additional resources, and with time to solve
problems. The whiteboard interview, much like the SAT is a somewhat
arbitrary gatekeeper that a candidate must prepare for and conquer.

This whole process tends to advantage those with the time and
background to prepare - students with time and resources to spend on
preparation.

I could be totally wrong but I seem to recall that the whiteboard
interview, at least in terms of external visibility grew out of the
Google puzzle interviews. 

A tech giant like Google can interview however they like and they'll
still get the talent. They go to the most selective institutions where
candidates have already been culled for success. If they then interview 100
candidates and 10 of them would be good fits, as long as a couple
thrive through the whiteboard interview process, they'll get their
engineer. They'll miss out on a lot of great talent but they can cast
such a large net they'll fill there seats. 

On the other hand, smaller companies will certainly miss out on great talent.

Is there a better way?

Some companies pre-assign mini projects and then discuss that at the
interview. Pairing could also be a lower stress alternative to the
technical interview. Another option would be to look at a candidates
existing projects. 

An interesting question is "why do so many companies use the
whiteboard interview?" I can't say for certain but I wouldn't be
surprised if it was a simple as "because Google does it."

For over 100 years, Stuyvesant high school required students study
mechanical drawing (drafting). The relevance of the lessened over the
decades and what was taught in many ways has become a joke. A typical
class during the CAD parts of the class might be going over the
**cylinder** command in CadKey. That's like spending a day studying
the **edit** menu in Microsoft Word in an English class. If you can't
tell, I'm not a fan.

The point is, there have been any number of smaller schools that have
also required students take drafting even though it doesn't prepare
students for, nor lead them to anything else that the school offers
(nb I feel much this way about Stuy's drafting requirement). I've
spoken to teachers and principals at these schools and we go back and
forth as I press them for the reason for the requirement and
ultimately, they tell me that their school requires drafting "because
Stuyvesant does."

Why do so many small companies employ the whiteboard interview?
Because the big kids do. The trouble is that the big kids can get away
with it, the smaller players on the other hand, are hurting
themselves. Even the bigger players would be well served to 
try to come up with an interview process that better assesses fit
rather than a course filter that while it does pull in talent misses
talent as well.
