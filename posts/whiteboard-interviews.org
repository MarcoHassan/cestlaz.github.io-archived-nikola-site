A few days ago, I saw a [[https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process%0A][piece]] on [[https://twitter.com/dhh][David Heinemeier Hansson's]] tweet on
whiteboard interviews:

I'm not a huge fan of the whiteboard interview but I found the tweets
in general to miss the point. Most of the whiteboard interviews I'm
aware of involve algorithmic problem solving while the tweets, at
least the ones I've seen all refer to things that indeed one would
look up and, at least to my knowledge aren't typically asked about in
whiteboard interviews.

Tim Bray takes that point of view in a [[https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/03/04/Whiteboard-Interviews][recent post]].



good and bad parts here



I could be totally wrong but I seem to recall that the whiteboard
interview, at least in terms of external visibility grew out of the
Google puzzle interviews. 

A tech giant like Google can interview however they like and they'll
still get the talent. If they interview 100 candidates and 10 of them
would be good fits, as long as a couple thrive through the whiteboard
interview process, they'll get their engineer.
