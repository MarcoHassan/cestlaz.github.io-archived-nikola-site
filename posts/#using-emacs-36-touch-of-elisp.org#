I've been working on a vue.js project this summer. During the school
year I really can't dive into code so it's been fun.

I've already showed you most of the Emacs tools I use for
development. Projectile, Ace-Window, IBuffer, Swiper / Ivy and
all. One thing I couldn't easily do was arrange windows the way I
wanted.

I've been setting up Emacs with one large window and a couple of
smaller ones:

#+BEGIN_SRC ditaa :file ../files/img/touch-elisp.png :exports none

|                                  |            |

|                                  |            |

I can easily switch the buffer in the window and I can easily switch
windows but what I wanted to do was swap the buffer in the large
window with one of the smaller buffers and leave focus in the larger
buffer:


#+BEGIN_SRC ditaa :file ../files/img/touch-elisp2.png :exports none


+----------------------------------+------------+
|                                  |            |

|                                  |            |
|                                  |            |
|    B                             +------------+
|                                  |            |
|                                  |     C      |
|                                  |            |
|                                  |            |
|                                  |            |

I started looking at perspective mode and persp mode but neither work
with the latest Emacs. After poking around at other packages I
realized that ace-window does most of what I wanted. Ace-window has a
function that swaps the buffers in two windows named
~ace-swap-window~. The only problem is that it leaves the focus on the
window you swap to not the one you started in. Ace-window also has
~aw-flip-window~ which then returns the cursor to the previous window.

With a little elisp, we get the behavior I was looking for which I
then bound to ~C-1 z~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun z/swap-windowsn ()
""
(interactive)
(ace-swap-window)
(aw-flip-window)
)

(define-key z-map (kbd "w") 'z/swap-windows)

The video goes into more details but it shows that if you're not
afraid to explore a bit you can pretty much get Emacs to do whatever
you want.
