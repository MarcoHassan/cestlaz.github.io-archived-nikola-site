I like to listen to music at work. Sometimes I just stream from
YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify or some other online source but if you're
a person of a certain age, like me, you probably have quite an mp3
collection. All those CDs that have been ripped not to mention some
converted vinyl.

I used to use the [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] or MPD back in the day. It would
run in the background and you could connect to it using lots of
[[https://www.musicpd.org/clients/][clients]].

When I was running Ubuntu and Mint Linux, I had some trouble setting
up MPD but the process is much smoother using Manjaro which is Arch
based and I'm currently enjoying.

Here's a video on how I set up MPD and also use Emacs to control it.

Coincidentally, on the same day I recorded this, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDEtZ7AKmwS0_GNJog01D2g/feed][Uncle Dave]] put up a
similar [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVN8UDScqk][video]]. Dave also sets up MPD on an Arch based linux but he
uses EMMS for his player. I ultimately end up with Simple-MPC with
briefs stops at the built in MPC mode and Mingus along the way.

Enjoy.
