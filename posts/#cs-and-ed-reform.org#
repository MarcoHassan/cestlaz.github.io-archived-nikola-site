I'm guessing my views  on this aren't very popular -that's OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.

A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren't careful, once the big
players get involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we're well on our way down
that road.
