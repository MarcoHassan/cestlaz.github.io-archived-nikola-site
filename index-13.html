I just read <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson's</a> predictions for next year. I was going
to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long
winded, I thought I'd comment in a post of my own.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't read Alfred's post yet, check it out:
<a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html">http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html</a>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-1">On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-1">
<p>
Alfred's probably right but I'm leery. Sure, it could end up terrific
but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.
</p>

<p>
We could end up with non-cs classes to count as CS or we could see
schools allowing real CS to count but there would be no incentive for
a school to actually create any meaningful CS classes
much less for kids to take them.
</p>

<p>
I guess the root of my concern probably relates two of my concerns
about education in general:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Real, experienced teachers aren't driving policy in education in
general and CS is and will  be no different. We're going to be left
with something forced down from above and I fear it will be bad.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not a big fan of education education. As schools of education
get involved they will have more of a voice. I think one of the
worst things to happen to math education over the course of my
career has been "Math Ed." I fear CS Ed will have the same effect
on K12 CS education.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Maybe I'm a pessimist or maybe I've just been burned one to many times
or maybe it's that as a public school teacher I see the negative
effect of politics and money on public education but at least in NYC I
see where the decision making is coming from and I'm not encouraged.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, even if I'm right and the powers that be really
screw things up,there should always be at least a few people who see
through they hype and that's where I can continue to do positive work.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-2">On Python continuing to grow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-2">
<p>
It's been one of my go to languages for a while now. I've been using
it in and out of classes since some time in the mid 90s.
</p>

<p>
I don't see it replacing Java in AP CS and it looks like Scratch has
the inside track CS Principles but it's good for so many things and
has such a low cost of entry, I again feel that Alfred's right. 
</p>

<p>
The fact that it's easy for a non-cs teacher to pick up, at least to a
limited degree, will certainly help the charge. I'm not sure if long
term, this is a good thing, but it will help to push python's growth in education.
</p>

<p>
As a side note on Java – I'm not personally a fan, but there good things in there that would be lost 
with a total shift to languages like Python.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-3">On CS Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-3">
<p>
I do see a time where the course is forced on Stuy but I'm
not worrying about it for the moment. I think we already teach a
stronger course and by the time CS Principles becomes an issue at
Stuy, I'll probably be gone.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-4">Chromebooks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-4">
<p>
I could see chromebooks working out for CS but only if schools don't
lock them down. Out of the box, you can only use cloud based
development environments. This is surely limiting but if you have the bandwidth, between
<a href="http://codesters.com/">codesters.com</a>, <a href="http://koding.com/">koding.com</a>, cloud9, Dr.Racket and assorted other tools
you can certainly do some good CS.
</p>

<p>
The upside comes when you can drop into the Linux shell. I've been
playing with a C720 Intel chromebook recently. It's small and
lightweight and once I set it up, it was running Dr. Racket, NetLogo,
Python, Java, Processing (all with a fairly hefty Emacs install).
</p>

<p>
Will it run everything? I don't know, but if I can get a new lab of
computers and have the freedom to custom install the machines, I'm
seriously considering chromebooks. 
</p>

<p>
I'm also recommending them to my kids looking for a cheap portable
development environment.

I've never been one for my own predictions - maybe because I'm more of
a continuous journey rather than destination type of guy so I'll hold
off on my own predictions for now, but I'll close with a direct
shoutout – Hey Alfred - thanks for posting your predictions - good food for thought 
as is your blog in general.

<p>
Spent most of vacation relaxing. Finished off the remaining college
recs, tried to catch up on sleep, and worked on a few project.
</p>

<p>
We've had an interesting December break dynamic in our household for
the past few years. My son, Natan is very much into his music, both as
a performer and a composer. A few years ago we discovered <a href="http://www.livingtraditions.org/docs/index_kk.htm">KlezKamp</a>. It
spoke to both Natan and Devorah. Batya, coming back from college
wasn't so into it and I was somewhat indifferent. 
</p>

<p>
The end result is that for most of the first half of the break, Batya
and I were left on our own in the city while Natan and Devorah were up
in the Catskills. 
</p>

<p>
So, what did we do? In addition to playing tourist, we rebuilt the
CSTUY web site (with a little help from her boyfriend Zach) - check it
out: <a href="http://cstuy.org/">cstuy.org</a>. I'm really happy with the result and now have a code
base that I'm happy with and can maintain.
</p>

<p>
I can't describe how awesome it is to be able to collaborate on
something real with ones daughter and I hope we can work on more
projects in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, I had my Natan time when he and Devorah got home. We spent
new years eve at the <a href="http://nygasp.org/">NYGASP</a> production of HMS Pinafore. Natan loves
opera and is something of a Savoyard and he's also a terrific
singer. Something he must have inherited from my father, although he
never met him.
</p>

<p>
So, we had our own project:
</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184357024&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>
His is the good voice singing Dick Deadeye and I'm the not so good one
doing Captain Corcoran. We recorded it A Capella and he added the midi
after the fact. I think he had to change the key and I'm sure he had
to mess with the tempo.
</p>

<p>
Some of you might have noticed that I worked on the tech project with
Batya and the artsy one with Natan but don't worry - Natan's planning
on majoring in <a href="https://github.com/NZamansky">Computer Science</a> and Batya's the musical director and
an alto in <a href="http://www.thechainotes.com/">The
Chai Notes</a> up at Cornell. 
</p>

<p>
So that was my break. Back to work in a couple of days.

<p>
In a <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2014/12/tech-companies-and-computer-science.html">recent post</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a> referred to an <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2012/12/advice-to-microsoft-education.html">earlier post</a> where he
mentioned rock star CS teachers. That's a term I've heard thrown
around a lot in the past few years. I've heard some of my graduates
referred to as rock stars - top tech people, and in fact I've seen
some of them courted for positions in a manner that a rock star might
be accustomed to. I've periodically referred to some of my colleagues
as rock stars, but I don't know if the term really fits. 
</p>

<p>
So, how else are us teacher folk referred to? More than once I've been
called <a href="http://avc.com/2014/04/ship-st-josephs-a-summer-coding-program-in-nyc/">the godfather of K-12 CS education in NYC</a>. Maybe because I've
been in the game so long or maybe because a friend once coined the
phrase "StuyCS Mafia" to refer to my graduates. It's flattering, but
like rock star, it doesn't quite fit the bill. Don Corleone rose to
power through both fear and respect. I certainly hope I'm not feared
and while I do believe that the people whose opinion I care about
respect me, it's far from universal.
</p>

<p>
So, where does that leave teachers like me, or more so, teachers I
aspire to be like?
</p>

<p>
Not the godfather and not rockstars.
</p>

<p>
We're bluesmen. 
</p>

<p>
Huh?
</p>

<p>
Well, the bluesman's got the chops that the rock star may or may not
have. In fact, the rock star always talks about how the bluesman was
his greatest influence and inspiration.
</p>

<p>
But, the rock star gets the accolades and the attention while the
bluesman toils in relative obscurity tending to his craft and if
acknowledged it's well after his career has ended.
</p>

<p>
So, there you have it. The best teachers I know are not rock stars,
they're bluesmen all about honing their craft and inspiring their
students.
</p>

<p>
One of the things Alfred talked about in his post is the top down
influence on CS education. On the one hand, it's brought attention to
bear but on the other hand it's being driven by people who don't
really get education.
</p>

<p>
The same can be said for the overall recent big money influences on
education.
</p>

<p>
We'd be much better off if those in power stopped playing rock star
and started listening to the bluesmen.

<p>
Yesterday, my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov">Stan</a> pointed me to this article: 
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/to-address-techs-diversity-woes-start-with-the-vanishing-comp-sci-classroom/">"To address tech’s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom"</a>
</p>

<p>
It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer
science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of
the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped
as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.
</p>

<p>
It made me think about the old vs new exams. The current APCS A exam
is roughly analogous to a typical college 101 course: programming in
one language and one paradigm. The old AB class represented a 101 and
a 102 with the 102 being data structures and algorithms. Much more
interesting for both guys and girls. Over the years, the AP A exam has
become more and more vocational, at least in my opinion, and that
makes matters worse. Its more and more about using the language and
built in collections and less about thinking and problem
solving. What's fun about that?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we teach our version, a super-set, of the AB curriculum over
the course of a school year.
</p>

<p>
Interesting that even though we teach that old school hardcore CS, we
far exceed the national numbers in terms of gender balance, but more
on that later.
</p>

<p>
One of the big things going on right now is the AP CS Principles
course. There's some good stuff in there but I've got a lot of
questions. 
</p>

<p>
To start, I'm tired of hearing that it's a college level course. If
a course is designed so that a 10th grader can be successful, it's not
college level. I do understand that it's being taught in places like
Berekely (and as an aside I both like and greatly respect Dan Garcia,
who's the architect of one version of CS principles - the Beauty and
Joy of Computing, and his work). If my kids were doing in college what
they could have been doing in 10th grade, something's wrong. That's
not to say that you can't have a similar course at both levels, just
that there's a <b><b>huge</b></b> difference between a 10th grader and a college
freshman. 
</p>

<p>
I also take issue with the drag and drop languages in high school and
beyond. True, there's a low cost of entry, but then it's limiting in
oh so many ways. Much slower than a keyboard interface, limited screen
real estate, and no clear exit to traditional textual
programming. Scratch and the like are probably good for younger kids,
but I've had to rescue many a kid from the damage done by drag and
drop. I'm not advocating starting a high schooler in Haskell with Vim
but there are plenty of tools that are both accessible, easy entry,
fun, but at the same time real.
</p>

<p>
We also see the proliferation of all girl after school programs. I
don't have any problem with this per se. I think we need some all
girls and some co-ed. In fact, one of the young ladies in our summer
program commented on how much she liked the fact that we weren't all
girls but we created a wonderful environment where everyone felt
comfortable and supported. 
</p>

<p>
Some of those programs do great things in terms of exposing girls to
role models and to what's possible. My issue is with the actual
education, notably because these programs invariably don't have real
educator/computer scientists running the show. They teach a watered
down CS or conversely too much too quickly and then the girls are
clobbered at the next level, they start doubting themselves and they
change majors.
</p>

<p>
The problems with these after school programs as well as with CS
Principles are the same. A few of my students who studied CS at
Harvard framed it nicely when talking about Harvard's highly
publicized CS50 course (I'm paraphrasing and combining thoughts here):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
They don't really teach anything, you've got to do it mostly on your
own. In the end you don't really learn anything.
</p>

<p>
Then, they go on to Harvard's next real CS class - functional
programming with no real preparation and they drop like flies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, what do you do?
</p>

<p>
You do what we did.
</p>

<p>
I developed an intro course over 10 years ago. The new AP Principles
course has some overlap in terms of concepts but one big difference is
that we dive into programming using two real languages. <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Scheme</a>, which
is mathy functional and <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml">NetLogo</a> which is visual and interactive but
still text based. We then move on to a number of really neat concepts
in Python. 
</p>

<p>
People say, "Oh, you do the NetLogo because it's visual and appeals to
girls." No - we do NetLogo because it's cool and it appeals to
kids. Same with Scheme. Show me a girl that loves the visual stuff,
I'll show you a girl that loves Scheme's functional goodness. I might
only be a dopey old school teacher, but I really believe "kids are
kids."
</p>

<p>
On top of this, you get great teachers that really know their stuff
(and we've built plenty of them over the years) and create a culture
with everyone's accepted and good things happen.
</p>

<p>
By the time our kids leave us, they've got enough under their belts so
they not only know their stuff but they have the confidence that they
know their stuff. 
</p>

<p>
How does it work for us? Nationally, about 19% of APCS test takers are
women. At Stuy, we hover around 30%. My Software Development, Post AP
classes are also around 30% so we keep them. Oh, and Stuy is only 40%
female and we do much worse than the national averages in other
traditionally male dominated fields such as physics.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, I was talking to one of our CSTUY hackers as we ended the
day. We were talking about possible directions to go in after the new
year. We could stay graphical, go to text processing, look at some
hardcore algorithms and more. I asked Aruna what she thought. Her
answer: "It's all fun."

About a month ago, I was at my 30 year high school reunion. Yesterday
I was at the class of 2009's 5 year one. Stuy 2004 also had their 10
year reunion last night.
</p>

<p>
It's always nice to be invited to reunions - I know it's largely
dependent on who's on the organizing committee but it's nice to be
remembered.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2014/10/25/reunions.html#.VHuvPJ-c30o">Last time</a> I wrote about Stuy reunions I noted how similar they all
are. It's something I've noticed over the years. The kids are all
unique but the vibe is the same. I tell people that the biggest
difference between my class reunion and the ones I attend as a teacher
is that I know more people when I'm there as a teacher. That's
probably more of a statement about me than the reunions or classes though.
</p>

<p>
Interesting to me was that I didn't really feel like I was at a Stuy
event. The people I chatted with were by and large part of our CS
family. We've got our own mailing list, have our own meetups and are
already a community that spans the years. It was nice to actually see
people, particularly the out of towners in person and it was nice to
speak to some of the people who are more comfortable lurking on our
list but it's not like we've been out of touch for the past five years.
</p>

<p>
It really cemented my feelings that my Stuy really doesn't have much
to do with the actual school any more. It's the kids and teachers I
work with right now and the many graduates that I now consider
friends. It's also the CSTUY kids from the summer and the kids that I
hope to work with in the future. There are more than a few non-Stuy
people that are part of the community as well.
</p>

<p>
That's my Stuy. On the one hand, it's pretty cool. We've got a
community that's around 700 people and spans almost four decades and
StuyCS is a known quantity in the tech world.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand it's kind of sad that I no longer feel passionate
about the institution that I attended as a kid and have worked at for
over 20 years.

I'm getting ready for my AP classes this morning. We're building a
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2011/12/03/wheres-waldo-text-style.html#.VG8qtt-c2Ak">word search generator</a> and we're at the point where we need to read a
list of words from a file
</p>

<p>
First, I'd better make sure I can do it. We're using the java
<b><b>scanner</b></b>, mostly because it's easy.
</p>

<p>
First cut:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">wl</span> {
    <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">static</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;">main</span>(<span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span>[] <span style="color: #ffff00;">args</span>) {
        <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">sc</span> = <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">File</span>(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"words"</span>));
        <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">while</span> (sc.hasNext()){
            <span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">s</span> = sc.next();
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Oh yes, I forgot the
</p>
<pre class="example">
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
</pre>


<p>
Oh, and also the fact that I've got deal with exceptions when working
with files:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">try</span> {
    <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">sc</span> = <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">File</span>(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"words"</span>));
    <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">while</span> (sc.hasNext()){
        <span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">s</span> = sc.next();
        System.out.println(s);
    }
} <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">catch</span> (<span style="color: #00ff00;">Exception</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">e</span>){
    System.out.println(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"Can't open file."</span>);
    System.exit(0);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But we don't want to wrap our entire program in an exception:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">try</span> {
    <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">sc</span> = <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">File</span>(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"words"</span>));
} <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">catch</span> (<span style="color: #00ff00;">Exception</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">e</span>){
    System.out.println(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"Can't open file."</span>);
    System.exit(0);
}

<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">while</span> (sc.hasNext()){
    <span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">s</span> = sc.next();
    System.out.println(s);

}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Now it doesn't work because the <b><b>Scanner sc</b></b> might not exist after the
try catch block (if an exception occurred), so we need:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">sc</span>
<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">try</span> {
    sc = <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Scanner</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">File</span>(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"words"</span>));
} <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">catch</span> (<span style="color: #00ff00;">Exception</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">e</span>){
    System.out.println(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"Can't open file."</span>);
    System.exit(0);
}

<span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">while</span> (sc.hasNext()){
    <span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">s</span> = sc.next();
    System.out.println(s);

}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
And now this doesn't work because <b><b>sc</b></b> might not have a value so we
finally get to the working version:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">java</span>.<span style="color: #ff00ff;">io</span>.*;

        } <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">catch</span> (<span style="color: #00ff00;">Exception</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">e</span>){
            System.out.println(<span style="color: #00ff00;">"Can't open file."</span>);
            System.exit(0);
        }
        <span style="color: #00ffff; font-weight: bold;">while</span> (sc.hasNext()){
            <span style="color: #00ff00;">String</span> <span style="color: #ffff00;">s</span> = sc.next();
            System.out.println(<span style="color: #00ff00;">s</span>);

        }
    }
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Really simple program but that's a long list of things that can go
wrong along the way. Nothing big, but each a stumbling block for a
beginning student that doesn't have the wealth of experience that
someone like me has. 
</p>

<p>
I had an interesting discussion with one of my seniors the other day
on this subject - all the base knowledge that experienced programmers
have that students don't and how we have to approach teaching so that
students are supported and not frustrated by these little but
important speed-bumps that they'll hit along the way.
</p>

<p>
I hope to write more about this soon, but for now I'll leave you to
ponder the issue.

I've said it many times:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Never use a tool you couldn't write yourself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is - make sure you understand what's going on under the hood.
</p>

<p>
In AP we've been playing with ArrayLists. The problem for today?
Create an ArrayList with consecutive integers and then write a routine
that will randomize the ArrayList.
</p>

<p>
For example, you might start with this ArrayList:
</p>

<pre class="example">
0,1,2,3,4,5
</pre>

<p>
and end up with
</p>

<pre class="example">
3,5,1,4,2,0
</pre>

<p>
First cut, the students grabbed a random element from the ArrayList,
removed it, and added it to the end of a new list. Then repeat until
the original list is empty and the new one is randomized. Then return
the list.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;">shuffle1</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">l</span>){
    <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">result</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt;();
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">while</span> (l.size()&gt;0){
        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = rnd.nextInt(l.size());
        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">v</span> = l.remove(i);
        result.add(v);
      }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> result;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Looks good.
</p>

<p>
Version two was much the same but after it removed a random value, it
added it to the end of the same ArrayList:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;">shuffle2</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">l</span>){
    <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">result</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt;();
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span>=l.size();s&gt;0;s--) {
        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = rnd.nextInt(s);
        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">v</span> = l.remove(i);
        l.add(v);
    }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> l;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then it was time to time. Both seemed pretty quick but as our data set
grew things seemed strange:
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="c4">
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="left">
<col class="left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">Size</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Time</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">100,000</td>
<td class="left">2 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">200,000</td>
<td class="left">7 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">400,000</td>
<td class="left">26 seonds</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>
We're just looping through an ArrayList, what's going on? When we
double the size of the list, it should just take double the time.
</p>

<p>
Since the class already wrote their own ArrayList implementation, they
were quick to realize that every time we removed an item from the
original Array, we were doing a linear or O(n) operation. That means
our algorithms, which look linear, are in fact O(N<sup>2</sup>). 
</p>

<p>
Can we do better? You bet. They just changed the remove and add to
using get and set. Instead off removing an item and re-inserting it,
just swap the randomly selected item with the last element:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;">shuffle3</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">l</span>){
    <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt; <span style="color: #a0522d;">result</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ArrayList</span>&lt;<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>&gt;();
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span>=l.size();s&gt;0;s--) {
        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = rnd.nextInt(s);

        <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">tmp</span> = l.get(i);
        l.set(i, l.get(s-1));
        l.set(s-1,tmp);
    }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> l;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
No removes so no hidden linear component.
</p>

<p>
The run time?
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="c4">
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="left">
<col class="left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">Size</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Time</th>

<tr>
<td class="left">100,000</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">400,000</td>
<td class="left">.17 seonds</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>
In fact, it took data sets in the size of millions before we even
broke more than a couple of seconds.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm looks the same but understanding what goes on under the
hood can make a big difference.

That's how I introduce myself whenever I attend a former student's
wedding. It leads to all sorts of confusion.
</p>

<p>
Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former
students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair
differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn't
recognize me – they had no reason to expect me, out of context and
all. I joined the conversation - able to go toe to toe on stories of
"the old days at Stuy." It really confused them. We all had a good
laugh when I outed myself.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, a many of my graduates have moved from student to
friend and I've shared life events with a number of them. Rule one is
that I don't reach out to them after graduation - that would just be
creepy. If, however, they reach out to me, then we stay in touch. As
an educator, even if it's a periodic note or update, it's something
that really touches me - it reminds me that even with all the teacher
bashing going on in this country, the kids, at least some of the time,
appreciate us.
</p>

<p>
This weekend was particularly memorable for me. I was at JonAlf and Jamie's
wedding. JonAlf falls in a special category. 
</p>

<p>
He was a former student and also on my fencing teams. I don't remember
how much we stayed in touch, but it must have been enough for me to
know that he minored in CS and was teaching high school at Brandeis.
</p>

<p>
When I heard Brandeis was being phased out and I saw we had a couple
of math openings, I tried to find him to bring him over to Stuy. You
try finding JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver in "the system." Is it Jon Dyrland?
Alf Weaver?  JonAlf Dyrland? Nothing worked. In any event I did
eventually find him. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to bring him on
in spite of his being a Stuy graduate with a CS background and a
successful teaching record. Nonetheless I kept trying and a couple of
years later I got him.
</p>

<p>
Since then, JonAlf has been my partner in crime. A kindred spirit whom
I describe him as a younger hipper version of me although the hip bar
was set pretty low to begin with.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the lunacy - The Blues Brothers, Austin Powers and
Dr. Evil, Clyde "Thluffy" Sinclair, the CS Semi Formal and all, he's
one of the best teachers I know.  A former student that I'm now proud
to call friend and colleague.
</p>

<p>
I was touched to be included in the festivities this weekend. I'm
incredibly proud of JonAlf as a teacher, a person, and a friend. He
and Jamie looked so happy together and I just know that their union
will be as amazing as Devorah and mine has been.
</p>

<p>
So this post is my way of raising a glass to JonAlf and Jamie.

How many times do we teach something and leave the kids thinking:
</p>

<p>
"what's the point of this?" "When will I use this?" or even just the
plain old fashioned "that's weird."
</p>

<p>
It's pretty cool when a lesson starts out that way but you get to the
payoff by the end of the class.
</p>

<p>
Today we started exploring some advanced python.
</p>

<p>
We started by showing that you can assign functions to variables or
pass them as parameters:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">inc</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> x+1
<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">dec</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> x-1

<span style="color: #a0522d;">f</span> = inc
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> f(5)

<span style="color: #a0522d;">flist</span> = [inc,dec]

<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> flist[1](5)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We then looked at closures in python:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">makeAdder</span>(n):
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">inner</span>(x):
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> x+n
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> inner

<span style="color: #a0522d;">add3</span> = makeAdder(3)
<span style="color: #a0522d;">add5</span> = makeAdder(5)

<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> add3(10)
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> add5(10)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea that we can make a function that builds and returns a
function. When we call <b><b>makeAdder(3)</b></b>, the 3 is passed as parameter
n so the inner function reduces to <b><b>return x+3</b></b> and then we return
that inner function. When we later run it: add3(10) it adds
10+3. makeAdder(5) works similarly but passing a 5 in for n instead
of a 3.
</p>

<p>
Even a somewhat clunky way of doing class type abstractions:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">make_counter</span>():
    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">private "instance" data</span>
    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">has to be a list due to weird python scoping rules</span>
    <span style="color: #a0522d;">count</span> = [0]

    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">public methods</span>
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">inc</span>():
        <span style="color: #a0522d;">count</span>[0]=count[0]+1
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">dec</span>():
        <span style="color: #a0522d;">count</span>[0]=count[0]-1
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">reset</span>():
        <span style="color: #a0522d;">count</span>[0]=0
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">get</span>():
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> count[0]

    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">send back a dictionary so we have access to all the methods</span>
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> {<span style="color: #8b2252;">'inc'</span>: inc, <span style="color: #8b2252;">'dec'</span>: dec, <span style="color: #8b2252;">'reset'</span>: reset, <span style="color: #8b2252;">'get'</span>: get}

<span style="color: #a0522d;">c1</span> = make_counter()
<span style="color: #a0522d;">c2</span> = make_counter()

<span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">we've got to use the clunky list notation </span>
c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'inc'</span>]()
c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'inc'</span>]()
c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'inc'</span>]()
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'get'</span>]()

<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> c2[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'get'</span>]()
c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'reset'</span>]()
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> c1[<span style="color: #8b2252;">'get'</span>]()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Up to now the students are able to see how this works but the why is
unclear.
</p>

<p>
So now we'll look at where this is useful.
</p>

<p>
Let's suppose we have routines like the following. It returns a
string:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">import</span> random
<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">get_name</span>():
    <span style="color: #a0522d;">names</span> = [<span style="color: #8b2252;">'tom'</span>,<span style="color: #8b2252;">'sue'</span>,<span style="color: #8b2252;">'harry'</span>,<span style="color: #8b2252;">'lisa'</span>,<span style="color: #8b2252;">'sarah'</span>,<span style="color: #8b2252;">'horatio'</span>]
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> random.choice(names)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
get<sub>name</sub> and routines like it might be scattered throughout our
code. Let's suppose, for some strange reason, we want to double the
name every time we use it. A "traditional" way of doing this might be:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">dble</span>(f):
    <span style="color: #a0522d;">name</span> = f()
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> name+name

<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> dble(get_name) <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">returns something like tomtom</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here, we pass a function which returns a string and then dble returns
that string repeated twice. The problem here is that if we've got
get<sub>name</sub> all over our code base, we have to find it and change each
instance to <b><b>dble(get<sub>name</sub>)</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What if we write it as a function that returns a function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">doubler</span>(f):
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">inner</span>():
        <span style="color: #a0522d;">name</span>=f()
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> name+name
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> inner
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, in this case, we can do something like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">make a new function that wraps get_name in "inner"</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">when we call inner, it returns the string twice</span>
<span style="color: #a0522d;">f</span> = doubler(get_name)
<span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">and then later</span>
<span style="color: #a020f0;">print</span> f() <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">will print something like tomtom</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The cool part is that we can also do this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a0522d;">get_name</span> = double(get_name)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And then whenever we call our new <b><b>get<sub>name</sub></b></b> we end up calling the
wrapped function. 
</p>

<p>
This was the first A-ha. We don't have to change get<sub>name</sub> all over our
code base - we only have to change it once.
</p>

<p>
Once we write a function like doubler, instead of re-assigning
get<sub>name</sub> as we did above, we can do the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #228b22;">@doubler</span>
<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">get_name</span>():
    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">rest of code as defined above</span>

<span style="color: #228b22;">@doubler</span>():
<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">demo</span>():
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"hello"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The second example will have demo return "hellohello" whenever we
invoke it.
</p>

<p>
A Python decorator is merely shorthand for calling a wrapper type
function like doubler.
</p>

<p>
This was the second A-ha moment – we can write functions that
transform functions.
</p>

<p>
We'll cover more decorator and closure plumbing tomorrow and then
start doing some fun stuff with these concepts.

<p>
We'll get back to CS content soon, but for now:
</p>

<p>
Last Tuesday was Election day - no students in the school - a day
devoted to professional development. Traditionally, math team coaches
from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures,
discussion, and general catching up. I've never actually attended
these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this
year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.
</p>

<p>
These meetings used to be organized by my late friend and colleague,
Rich Geller so it made sense that we took time at end of the day to
honor his memory and unveil a memorial dedicated to Rich and his
work. Rich was a legendary Stuy teacher, but more on that shortly.
</p>

<p>
As I looked at Rich's memorial, I couldn't help and turn my head
around to gaze at another memorial - "Celebration" - created to honor
the memory of another legendary teacher that died before his time -
Richard Rothenberg.
</p>

<p>
Both of these men were friends and mentors. I thought I'd dedicate
this post to some of the things I learned from both of them.
</p>


<div class="row">

<div class="c6">
<h2>Rich (Doc)</h2>

<div class="center">
<figure><img height="250px" src="img/rich-rich/doc.jpg"><figcaption>Celebration - the Rothenberg Memorial</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>
Richard Rothenberg, known to me as Richie or Doc was the math chair
when I was a senior. He taught AP Computer Science that year and he
hired me back a few years later.
</p>

<p>
He didn't give me my first teaching gig. He knew that I had to go
somewhere else to develop my chops. We did stay in touch, though, and
he hired me two and a half years later.
</p>

<p>
Doc was an amazing teacher but he was also someone who worked 
tirelessly behind the scenes for the good of his students.
</p>

<p>
I remember one year he heard that one our recent graduates got into
some trouble at college. Doc got wind of this and went out of his way
to contact the college on the student's behalf. The student never
knew. That was Doc.
</p>

<p>
He also understood the "big picture."
</p>

<p>
I was at a parents association meeting early in my Stuy career. All of
the assistant principals were taking turns talking to an audience of
Freshman parents.
</p>

<p>
Each got up  and started to brag about their program:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We had n intel semi finalists last year
</li>
<li>Our kids won whatever essay writing contest
</li>
<li>Six kids won gold medals in…
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each AP was bragging about how awesome their department was but in
truth they were talking about a handful of excellent kids who would
have excelled no matter where they went. I'd guess Stuy or at least
Stuy's educational programs probably had very little to do with these
top kid's development and in any event, this wasn't really relevant to
parents of incoming students.
</p>

<p>
Then it was Richie's turn.
</p>

<p>
Richie got up and said the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Go home, hug your children, ask them how their days were.
Encourage them and support them.
Everything else will work itself out.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That really stayed with me. So few teachers look beyond their field. I
remember talking to one of the best chemistry teachers I know - I
asked "what do you do knowing that most of your kids won't be and in
fact shouldn't be chemists?" The reply was that he looked at all his
students as though they all wanted to be and were going to be
chemists. Doc looked at his students as whole people first -
mathematicians second. That's one of the many lessons I learned from Doc.
</p>

</div>

<div class="c6 leftborder">
<h2>Rich (Richard)</h2>

<div class="center">
<figure><img height="250px" src="img/rich-rich/geller.jpg"><figcaption>The Rich Geller Memorial Display</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>
Richard Geller was never my teacher. He was my colleague and friend.
</p>

<p>
He introduced me to fine dining and wine. We talked food, biking, and
teaching.
</p>

<p>
Rich had a reputation for being unyielding and strict. Many students
went into his class in fear but just as many came back after
graduating to thank him.
</p>

<p>
I remember one of our mutual students saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I need to be in Mr. Geller's once every three terms to keep me in good
habits. Then I need a couple of pushover teachers in between to pump
up my GPA.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He was a top math teacher but his students learned much
more. Responsibility, respect, having care and pride in one's work,
and more.
</p>

<p>
Rich was a demanding teacher and one who really cared about his
students. When grads came back from college and Rich would great them
with a smile. The scary teacher was gone. He asked how and what the
graduates were doing and he honestly cared. Gone was the in class
persona. That was business. 
</p>

<p>
In some ways Rich was much like an earlier Stuyvesant math
legend. Phil Fisher, who terrorized us poor calc students in the
'80s. I got to know Phil when I came back as a teacher and once he
explained why he was so rigid and strict in class. Phil explained that
here he was, charged with teaching these amazing talented Stuy
students while at the same time, he felt he wasn't nearly as smart as
them. Phil needed 100% focus during every minute of every class to
give the kids what they deserved. 
</p>

<p>
I think Rich was something like that. Not exactly the same, he also
wanted the kids to learn to be responsible and respectful but I think
the core idea was the same.
</p>

<p>
As a colleague and friend, Rich was the first guy to show appreciation
and the guy with enough character to tell you not what you wanted to
hear but what you needed to hear. I also learned to always be open and
honest with my team. Make sure everyone had all the information.
</p>


</div>
</div>

<p>
I learned a lot from both of these men. Stuyvesant misses them and I
miss them, but the there influence lives on through me, their
students, colleagues and friends.
