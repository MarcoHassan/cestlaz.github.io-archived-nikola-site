Today we're looking at <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> 2016 <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2">number 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
To change things up, I thought I'd do a video where I live code a solution.
</p>

<p>
The solution I present is pretty straightforward - use a 2D array (or
technically, an array of strings) to represent the keypad, parse the
input, and follow the input instructions to build the code. 
</p>

<p>
One of the things I really like about Advent of Code is that every
problem has two parts and depending on how you solved part 1, you may
or may not have extra work to do for part 2.
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, I wrote about one of the coding techniques I
try to convey to my students. The idea of <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md">changing the data</a> to take
away edge and special cases. 
</p>

<p>
Part two of this problem is a perfect time to use that technique.
</p>

<p>
Here's the video, I hope you enjoy it:

    <p>
I recently <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-of-code-2016/">posted</a> about <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> - a series of programming
problems relseased one a day. While they vary in terms of level of
difficulty, a number of them make nice problems for introductory to
mid level programming classes.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on a few of them starting with
the first problem from this years competition.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1">Take a minute to read it over.</a>
</p>

<p>
At first glance, it might seem to a young programmer that this problem
requires a two dimensional array - all about (x,y) coordinates but
then there's a problem - there are no limits on coordinates and we
can't make an unlimited size array.
</p>

<p>
After thinking a bit, hopefully the programmer realizes that all they
need to do is keep track of the how the <b><b>(x,y)</b></b> location changes over
time. In the solution below, we start at <b><b>(0,0)</b></b> and count the steps as
we update two variables <b><b>x</b></b> and <b><b>y</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
When we finish processing the moves, we have our current location in
<b><b>(x,y)</b></b> and we have the number of steps taken to get there.
</p>

<p>
The solution below hsa a couple of niceties that a beginning
programmer might not know or use (and I'm not arguing that what's written is
superior in any way, it's just what I ended up writing).
</p>

<p>
I make use of tuple destructuring:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
which assigns <b><b>x</b></b> to the first item in the tuple and <b><b>y</b></b> the
second. I used that a number of times 
</p>

<p>
I also use a list  I call <b><b>dirs</b></b> to hold dx and dy values for the
four direcitons:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">dirs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This made it easier to to update the location based on the 4
directions. I could also have just used if statements.
</p>

<p>
Here's all the code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># assume our starting location is 0,0</span>

<span class="c1"># we start with d=0 -&gt; facing north</span>
<span class="c1"># as we turn left or right, we can just increment or decrement d</span>
<span class="c1"># and dirs[d] will give us the appropriate dx and dy to update</span>
<span class="c1"># our locatoin for the next step</span>
<span class="n">dirs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)]</span>   
<span class="n">d</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="c1"># This is only needed for part 2  - We track visited locations</span>
<span class="c1"># by adding them to the dictionary. If we try to add a location</span>

Overall, a nice little problem for beginning and intermediate

Not much in today's actual post. The video is a continuation of the last one on <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1">org-capture</a>.
</p>

<p>
The video goes over how I set things up to pop up a new frame to do a
capture even if emacs isn't on screen (as long as it's running) by
hitting <b><b>F1</b></b>. I would  have preferred to bind to <b><b>C-c c</b></b> - the
same as within emacs but I havn't figured out how to do that in Ubuntu
or Mint Linux yet.
</p>

<p>
Here's the elisp code for the configuration file to do the heavy
lifting. I can't for th elife of me remember who's blog I found it
on. If anyone knows, please leave a comment - I'd like to give credit
where credit's due:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defadvice org-capture-finalize 
    (after delete-capture-frame activate)  
  "Advise capture-finalize to close the frame"  
  (if (equal "capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))  
    (delete-frame)))

(defadvice org-capture-destroy 
    (after delete-capture-frame activate)  
  "Advise capture-destroy to close the frame"  
  (if (equal "capture" (frame-parameter nil 'name))  
    (delete-frame)))  

(use-package noflet
  :ensure t )
(defun make-capture-frame ()
  "Create a new frame and run org-capture."
  (interactive)
  (make-frame '((name . "capture")))
  (select-frame-by-name "capture")
  (delete-other-windows)
  (noflet ((switch-to-buffer-other-window (buf) (switch-to-buffer buf)))
    (org-capture)))
</pre></div>

<p>
The command I bind to the keyboard shortcut in my window manager:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>emacsclient -ne "(make-capture-frame)"
</pre></div>

<p>
There will be a third capture video in a few weeks where I'll talk
about scheduling and agendas. Right now, I'm playing with org-gcal to
sync with my Google calendar and want to figure out a config I'm happy
with before making that video.

Once again, it's time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> - a series of small
programming problems released once a day. 
</p>

<p>
I wrote a bit about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-15-advent.html/">last</a> <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-12-17-im-an-idiot.html/#.WEMqBB9ieYQ">year</a> and you can still find last years
problems <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice
for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I'm thinking of
looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think about this much last year but one thing I really like
about the competition is that each problem comes in two parts. You're
first presented with the problem and the input and once you put in the
correct answer, you're presented with part two.
</p>

<p>
This can be annoying at times, particularly when it requires a large
code rewrite but it also means that well designed, not too specific
solutions are rewarded. 
</p>

<p>
It's not quite the same as changing the specs on a project mid way but
it does encourage thinking about more than just solving a super
specific problem.
</p>

<p>
Check out <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> and see if it's something you or your classes
might enjoy.

Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to
get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or
would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote
positions you disagree with.
</p>

<p>
Tough question.
</p>

<p>
The original question implied national level positions. I've never and
will never breath such rarefied air but I have had such experiences
closer to ground level, both with DOE projects and also in
conversations with some charter chains.
</p>

<p>
My take?
</p>

<p>
Anyone that knows me knows that I've had various dealings with the NYC
DOE and also knows that those dealings never resulted in outcomes I
was happy with. Over my time at Stuy, I had many philosophical
differences with Tweed (a common nickname for the NYC DOE as they're
housed in the old Tweed courthouse) and these were times where I tried
to play nice to have a seat at the table.
</p>

<p>
Once I was at a meeting that also included a number of tech industry
heavy hitters. After the meeting, one came over to me. He knew me
by having worked with my former students. I knew him by reputation. He
asked "do they really want our thoughts on this or are we just here so
that they can do what they wanted in the first place and then parade us out 
to say that they consulted experts in the tech industry?" I honestly
didn't know at the time but I had my doubts as to the DOE's sincerity
in being open to either my views or this CTO's As it turned out, they
just did want to parade us. Later in the process, I was told in a back
room that it would be wise of me not to publicly voice my thoughts
about the direction of one particular project.
</p>

<p>
So there you have it. I was given a seat at the table but only as long
as my views mirrored the views of those in power. Not really much of a
seat. 
</p>

<p>
I've also sat down with some charter chains - chains that I've been
more than happy to denounce publicly. Why did I take the meetings?
Mostly to find out if I was mistaken in my position and if so, maybe
I could help them. Every time I've had such a meeting, however, I've
left the table with my feelings unchanged and knowing that I would
never willingly help them as I felt their practices were harmful to
kids.
</p>

<p>
In one case, I took the seat but failed to affect change. In the other
I refused the seat. I'll always take a meeting and I'll always work
with someone who wants to help kids and who has an open mind but I've
found that the more powerful the player, at least in education, the
more likely they are to just want confirmation of their own bias.
</p>

<p>
You might get a seat at the table but you also might end up lending
your reputation to a cause you don't believe in.
