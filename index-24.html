Second video in the Flask series. This one goes over installing Flask
in a virtualenv and running a simple Flask application.
</p>

<p>
Nothing much to say about this other then check out the video:

Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have
finally arrived. We're distributing them on Monday. Each student will
have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they're in the
program. 
</p>

<p>
This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying
and sharing our projects.
</p>

<p>
For this type of web development, I'm a big fan of using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>. Flask
is a Python microframework. The easiest analogy is saying it's like
Ruby on rails but in Python. That's close enough for our purposes.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer Python to Ruby as a teaching tool because it leads to
roads going in all sorts of directions so it was merely a matter of
figuring out which framework or platform to use. I found Django to be
far too big, cumbersome, and all encompasing while on the other hand,
<a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/">Werkzeug</a>, which Flask is based on is a little too low level.
</p>

<p>
Flask hit the sweet spot. Easy routing, session and form handling,
templates, pretty much everything I was looking for but very
unopinionated and open ended. Perfect for teaching and learning and
perfect for lightweight projects. The sourecode is also
straightforward enough for a student to explore.
</p>

<p>
Below is a video going over setting up Linux from right after an
install to use the python virtualenv package. The next video will go
over installing Flask and setting up a simple application. Later, I'll
post a video on deployment to a <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> Droplet.
</p>

<p>
Here are some notes relating to the video.
</p>

<p>
First, go to your "software sources" or "software updates"
 application from the menu and select all the sources (as described n
 the video)
</p>

<p>
To update a new system:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgade
</pre></div>

<p>
To install the most recent emacs snapshot
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-add repository -y ppa:ubuntu-lisp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
</pre></div>

<p>
To install python pip (used to install other python packages)
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre></div>

<p>
and then to install the virtualenv packages
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install virtualenv
</pre></div>

<p>
To create a python3 virtual environment
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install -p python3 venv-folder
</pre></div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can activate the envorinment (assuming you create the folder under
</li>
</ul>
<p>
your home directory):
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">source</span> ~/venv-folder/bin/activate
</pre></div>

<p>
And to deactivate it, from the activated terminal
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>deactivate
</pre></div>

<p>
Here's the video. Next time, we'll install Flask into an virtual
environment.

If you use emacs, you should keep an eye on Jon Snader's <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/">blog</a>,
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/">irreal.org</a>. A few days he posted on <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5621">Undo Tree</a> - a package that extends
Emacs's built in undo functionality.
</p>

<p>
Basic emacs has undo, bound to <b><b>C-/</b></b> or <b><b>C-_</b></b> but that's about
it. Undo tree, which you can set up with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">undo-tree</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-undo-tree-mode</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
adds two key features. First is redo, which you get by adding the
shift key to the undo keychords. 
</p>

<p>
The other, is the visual undo tree. You can bring that up wit <b><b>C-x
u</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Once you bring up the undo tree, you can use the up and down arrows or
<b><b>C-n</b></b> and <b><b>C-p</b></b> to move between undo and redos. When you get to
what you want, just quit the undo tree visualizer with <b><b>q</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
The cool part is that once you undo a few things and add new stuff,
you get a tree that you can navigate through using the arrows. 
</p>

<p>
It's much easier to get the flavor of this by watching the video
(which also has a lame example of using artist-mode which I'll come
back t at some point).
</p>

<p>
Enjoy.

The discussion today over on <a href="http://avc.com">AVC</a> was <a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/chromebooks-in-k12/">Chromebooks in K12</a>, a title I
conveniently lifted.
</p>

<p>
In the comments, I was asked my thoughts on chromebooks vs Linux on
low end hardware so, here they are.
</p>


<p>
Chromebooks are cheap, near instant on, and, if you're using Google
Apps for education, little to no administration necessary. 
</p>

<p>
This is a HUGE win for schools. 
</p>

<p>
There are some issues. School WiFi, for example, is frequently
insufficient which can be a problem for a device that's meant to be
connected to the cloud. People might think that schools are well
connected but I know multiple schools that keep kids off the WiFi to
keep it from being overloaded. This is a problem and I don't know if
it's really being addressed.
</p>

<p>
It's also worth noting that DOE pricing is also a far cry from "lowest
bidder." We keep seeing sub $200 chromebooks on the market but buying
through the DOE approved vendor looks to cost about $300 per unit or
more. Of course this is better than the equally inflated PC/Mac
prices.
</p>

<p>
Still, the price and easy of deployment and administration seem to
make chromebooks the way to go.
</p>

<p>
As to other issues, first, you have to buy in to the Google platform
– email, docs, classroom, etc. This isn't necessarily a problem. I
personally like most of Google's offerings. My big concern is giving
away student data. I have mixed feelings on the whole privacy thing
but it's more clear cut when it comes to minors in public schools -
schools shouldn't be sharing their data and schools shouldn't be
forcing them to share their data. Google Suite for Education is FERPA
compliant but what about all the other Google services the kids might
be using? I haven't looked at this carefully but we've already given
too much power to private interests over education (see the College
Board or Pearsons) so, at least to me, this is a concern.
</p>

<p>
My only other issue is a selfish one. As a CS educator, I look to
coding tools and environments. While there are online platforms like
cloud9 or <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>, they don't have the same power and flexibility of
using local installs. I've been using repl.it and it's a great tool
but I think it's best used as a stepping stone to a local install and
then afterwards for some of it's specific value added features. I'm
also a big believer in teaching <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/shell/">operating system as tool box</a>,
something you can't currently do with a chromebook.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/willykaram">Willy Karam</a> commented over at AVC about using cheap hardware running
Linux. This is something I've done for years and it's been a
lifesaver. CSTUY's entire laptop collection consists of really old
laptops running Linux. 
</p>

<p>
For a CS class, this works well. Even for a non CS class it can work
well. Modern Linux distributions run pretty much the same as Windows
and MacOS. Use the mouse to click on menus and icons. It doesn't give
you the power of the command line but it means it's a suitable
alternative for the masses that use the operating system as a program loader..
</p>

<p>
The downside of Linux for the general population is the administration
and maintenance. At Stuy, we set up NIS and NFS. Both horrible but
probably easier and better than most alternatives. I was never able to
come up with a better way to do authentication and file sharing and
the NFS stuff would have killed our wifi (we only used it in wired
labs). Customizing software installs is also a real problem. We made
it work but it took far too much time and effort.
</p>

<p>
If you're in a situation where you can do a stock install and then
give the machine to the student for the semester, then Linux can work
really well. If you're talking about shared machines with custom
installs, it's harder to justify over chromebooks. 
</p>

<p>
A final note on chromebooks is that last year, I played with putting Linux on a
chromebook. It worked pretty well. Almost the best of both worlds. Low
end hardware with good battery life and a full operating system. This
is something I have to play with on the current generation of chromebooks.
</p>

<p>
So, where do I stand on this? The cloud isn't there yet in terms of
teaching computer science. It's fine for a gentle introduction but
eventually, you'll need the power of a full blown OS and local
installs. We may very well get to where a cloud OS is just as
expressive, we're just not there yet. On the other hand, for general
computing in schools, chromebooks are a big win.
</p>

<p>
It would be wonderful if schools had sufficient infrastructure,
support staff and training so that technology was just there and just
worked and we didn't have to make these sort of decisions and
compromises. Somehow I don't thing that will be happening any time soon.
