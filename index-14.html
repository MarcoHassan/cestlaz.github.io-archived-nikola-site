Big announcement the other day. Code.org will be partnering with the 
College Board. 
</p>

<p>
They'll help school's adopt their CS courses and provide funding for
Code.org's professional development.
</p>

<p>
You can read about it on Code.org's blog <a href="http://blog.code.org/post/118964845433/college-board-and-code-org-announce-an-alliance-to">here</a> and a USA Today article
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/14/codeorg-college-board-computer-science-high-school-diversity/27304593/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Already it's made it's rounds with Alfred Thompson giving his take on
his blog over <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/05/expanding-computing-educationare-we.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sounds terrific.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sold.
</p>

<p>
I do believe that Code.org has the best of intentions and they've been
front and center on the PR front for CS Education - that's great but
they also seem to be taking that startup mentality - scale, scale,
scale, fast, fast, fast. It's the drop in curriculum plus PD
approach. I wrote about it about a month ago <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/04/expedient-vs-good.html#.VVvHnt-c30o">here</a>. I hope I'm wrong,
but we'll see.
</p>

<p>
What I really want to comment on here is the whole College Board
piece. The kicker is the PSAT 8/9 - a new PSAT exam for eighth and ninth
graders. The Code.org blog says that schools will be encouraged to use
this exam. The USA Today piece says that schools that use the PSAT 8/9
will receive funding to subsidize the Code.org stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Either way, it's a concern.
</p>

<p>
As it stands, kids have to take either the SAT or ACT for college
acceptance (for the most part). I know that now the College Board says
that the SAT measures college readiness but I recall a few years ago
they proudly proclaimed that the SAT could only predict one thing: how
a student would do on the next SAT. 
</p>

<p>
So, if the SAT has little value, the PSAT has less, other than
possible entry to scholarships. Taking the test down to eight or
ninth grade seems to have little to no value for students and don't tell me that
an SAT style test in the 8th grade can determine if you'll be a good
computer scientist or not.
</p>

<p>
What is it about? 
</p>

<p>
Call me cynical, but I think the College Board is looking for a new
cash cow. 
</p>

<p>
Districts push the PSAT 8/9 saying it's good for kids and
force the kids to take an additional test. Since schools and districts
typically pay for the PSAT, the taxpayers fork over money year after
year and funnel it to the College Board and get no real value in
return. To make it all seem kosher, the College Board kicks in a
little for the Code.org training, for whatever that's worth.

Since I wrote a post on my problem with drop in curricula on March 4
(<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/04/expedient-vs-good.html">http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/04/expedient-vs-good.html</a>)
I've been meaning to follow up with some of my thoughts on after
school and summer programs. 
</p>

<p>
This itch was further spurred when I read this post on <a href="http://avc.com">avc.com</a>:
<a href="http://avc.com/2015/03/numbers-can-ruin-a-good-story/">http://avc.com/2015/03/numbers-can-ruin-a-good-story/</a>. It talks about
startups - you can have a good story and raise some funds but then
when numbers, that is, results start to come in, that story might not
look so good.
</p>

<p>
The world of CS Education summer and after school programs are full of
"good stories." My favorite is "your kid will learn how to build an
iPhone app in 4 weeks!!!" If it were that easy, we wouldn't have a
tech talent shortage and my grads wouldn't be in such high demand. 
</p>

<p>
The truth is, it's very easy to get by in CS Education on nothing more
than a good story. You never actually have to show real results. Most
of the programs out there follow this pattern. I don't think it's
intentional. It's just that most people running K12 CS Ed programs
aren't educators and frequently they aren't CS people. What they are
concerned is scaling so that they can get to as many kids as
possible. They aren't dealing with next steps. Besides, to them, it
appears they're doing great work - they buy into their own hype.
</p>

<p>
What's the problem?
</p>

<p>
Simple - learning takes time.
</p>

<p>
How do you set up the story?
</p>

<p>
Easy.
</p>

<p>
Start by promising an awesome program - an awesome project after two
or four weeks. With today's tools it's easy to make a mock up. Either
you use simplified tools or you can use a lot of boilerplate code with
pre-built components. These aren't necessarily bad in and of
themselves, just don't pretend you're teaching the real deal.
</p>

<p>
It's easy to pull this off since there's no real follow up. Kids are
then sent back to their high schools or off to college and results
aren't tracked.
</p>

<p>
Also, make sure you recruit some high performing kids. I know a number
of programs that have taken in my Stuy kids even though they already
know more than the program has to offer. This guarantees that your
program will look good since these kids <b><b>will</b></b> produce great projects.
</p>

<p>
I recall about a year and a half ago reading an article. It
highlighted a youngster who went through one of these summer
programs. A bright kid in a well regarded, well hyped, well funded
program. I've don't think the article said so, but I heard many of this
programs top people repeatedly say "our program better prepares our
kids for the AP Computer Science exam than the AP course itself does."
Hmmm. Well, in the article, the kid learned all these wonderful things
from the program and then went back to high school.
</p>

<p>
A short time after, according to the piece, the kid was struggling in
AP Computer Science and the article quickly threw the teacher under
the bus. Now, I have no idea if the teacher was any good but if your
program better prepares a kid for the exam than the class, there's not
way the kid should have been struggling - unless, of course, it was
all a story.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, that the designers and implementers of many of these programs
don't know education and often know little CS. I can't tell
you the number of kids that have come into my classes and programs
proclaiming to be master programmers as a result of these programs and
it turns out all they know is how to build a limited drag and drop
prototype or how to tweak a pre-built template.
</p>

<p>
What's the harm? In my classes and programs, we can educate the kids
but if this is in college with less support, self doubt will creep in
and more often than not the kid will drop tech. I've seen it happen
many a time.
</p>

<p>
That brings me to the next story – the glue programs. I also see a
lot of this. Programs that teach the very rudiments of programming and
then use pre-built libraries and packages to make really impressive
looking results. They look great, but there's not a lot of substance
under the hood. I remember seeing a number of these "finished
products" and each time noting that the student contributed maybe 20 to
40 lines of code and they were mostly tweaks to the web site samples.
</p>

<p>
The final story is less of a story and more legit in terms of teaching
but it still largely a story. That's when a program tries to teach too
much to quickly. I've seen one and two week programs that promise the
word. The kids put together some impressive stuff but since it's so
much so fast, facilitated by lots of coaching, there's little
retention and questionable understanding. 
</p>

<p>
I was talking to a friend a few months ago. She worked with a number
of high achieving kids teaching them to code. All seemed great. They
got the kids back together months later for a follow up. I asked "how
was the retention?" The reply "that's a real problem."
</p>

<p>
the truth is learning takes time. There's only so much you can do in
an after-school or in a summer and it's not always flashy. 
</p>

<p>
When I designed Google CAPE NYC for the summer of 2010 I knew we
couldn't do everything in a month. What we did do is give the kids the
fundamentals and a path to follow to learn more. They did neat
projects but they weren't the over the top stuff you see other
programs produce (as an aside, one of my grads noted - "If it looks
too good to be true, it probably isn't true."). While we didn't
formally track the kids, 3/4 of the kids we were still in touch with
last year were still doing computer science at a second year college
level so I know what we did worked but I haven't seen that type follow
up from any other program.
</p>

<p>
We're in the midst of recruiting and fund-raising for my non-profit,
<a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>'s summer program, <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/ship">SHIP</a>. We're not as connected as the big CS
programs and we don't have the hype. That makes our job harder. 
</p>

<p>
What I do know is that we've got the best teachers and the best
program and that our kids might not make something quite so flashy
after three or four weeks as some of the other programs, our kids are
set up for long term success.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're looking for a great program with great teachers and a
solid plan, check out CSTUY. If you want to create a story, just follow
these steps:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recruit some high achieving kids so you'll have some stories
</li>
<li>Teach a framework or simplified tool 
</li>
<li>Coaching, coaching, coaching.
</li>
<li>Make sure they have fun so you get good reviews
</li>
<li>Profit!!!!
</li>

<p>
This past Saturday, 50 high school students, 10 high school mentors, and 10
more post high school mentors headed down to <i>SumAll</i> to participate in
<b><b>def hacks(2015):</b></b> <i>CSTUY</i>'s first hackathon.
</p>

<p>
The fifty participants, came from all over the city, Long Island, and
New Jersey. They ranged from having never programmed to three or four
years experience. 
</p>

<p>
Projects ranged from web sites to full stack applications. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
After workshops run by CSTUY teachers and mentors and also by
<a href="http://codesters.com">Codesters.com</a> the hackers spread out all over SumAll's offices, working in small
groups with the support of our amazing mentors.

built new skills, met new people, and gotten a little swag.

The judges singled out two groups for special
recognition. One was a team of four experienced programmers who put
together a full stack app to help schedule parent/teacher meetings.

That one really blew me away. We were able to give these groups
Raspberry Pis thanks to a last minute donation from <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>.

Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
</p>

<p>
We're busy organizing <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY's</a> first <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">hackathon</a>. It's going to be at
<a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>, where we hold our weekly <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">hacking sessions</a> but while taking
registration, we had a little program.
</p>

<p>
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story – when
people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts,
many don't show. I asked all of the applicants to confirm by filling
out a second Google doc.
</p>

<p>
Then it got to reminder time - I wanted to send an email out to all
those kids who signed up on the first form, but hadn't confirmed on
the second. 
</p>

<p>
Two Google spreadsheets with an email field. I needed all the people
on sheet 1 that weren't on sheet 2. I'm sure there's some
spreadsheet-fu that accomplishes this, but nothing I know. I also
could have written a little python script which isn't so bad, but this
was a perfect time to turn to the shell.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how a command line guy would do this.
</p>

<p>
To start, I put the emails in two files: e1 and e2. The first has
all the original applicants, the second those that confirmed.

Last post was a little heavy so just a short fun one for today.
</p>

<p>
"Just another day at StuyCS." That was the subject of the email Brian
sent with the photo above. What's going on?
</p>

<p>
We're working on advanced JavaScript while also looking at
<i>Backbone.js</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Now, as sometimes happens, Batya, while in her CS class up at college,
decided to open up a Google chat with me. This happens now and then. We try to
have some fun with it. We actually have a plan to mess with the kids
later this term, but I'll keep that to myself.
</p>

<p>
Now, Batya, of course, was sitting in her CS class in college. I told
her what we were doing and continued with the lesson.  She responded
that Zach, her boyfriend and my former student said not to forget to
emphasize certain things. I also asked Batya if her professor was
having a chat with his kid while he was teaching. Everyone was having a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Then things got sillier. Another chat popped up. It was Natan, my son,
who happens to be in that class. So, the insanity continued on when I
get a video call -  it was from Aida sitting in row 1 - that's what you
see on the screen. 
</p>

<p>
Now it was getting a little ridiculous and it all started with Batya
and Natan. So, what's a a teacher to do? I had to contact their
parent, my wife, to tell her to discipline her children. That's the
third chat. 
</p>

<p>
So, just another day at StuyCS.

<p>
I heard that the other day. It was a comment relating to a number of
efforts, both in and out of  NY to get CS into the classroom.
</p>

<p>
These programs abound and up front let me say that they're all well
meaning and have the best of intentions.
</p>

<p>
In NYC, programs receiving money, publicity, and support, include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Software Engineering Pilot (SEP)
</li>
<li>Google CS First afterschool
</li>
<li>The NSF grant bring the Beauty and Joy of Computing class to NYC (BGP)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Terrific – we'll scale up CS ed in NY from nothing to everyone in no
time. It's fast, it scales. But is it good.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I'd argue that maybe it's not. These programs all share a few things
in common. 
</p>

<p>
First, they're all expedient. You can implement them in an election
cycle. Roll out a pre-fab curriculum with scripted lessons, give the
teachers a summer and some weekend workshops and we're good to go. No
CS knowledge needed.
</p>

<p>
Next, as far as I can tell, none were developed by experienced high school
teachers with a deep knowledge of CS. 
</p>

<p>
The SEP was originally developed by someone, who, according to his
linked in profile never coded and never taught.
</p>

<p>
I could be wrong about BGP. It was developed by Dan Garcia - an
educator whom I like and respect, but as far as I know, his experience
is at the college level. 
</p>

<p>
And Google's CS First? I've been very impressed by Google's engineers,
in fact, many are my former students. It's high school education team?
Not so much.
</p>

<p>
Finally, these efforts buy into the myth that anyone can teach and
that anyone can teach computer science. Even worse, the Google CS
First claims people running their program don't need to know a thing
about computer science.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who knows teaching knows that you can't learn a subject well
enough to reall teach it in such a short period of time. Of course,
it does align itself with education "reform" where the true master
teacher is no longer desirable and we should all be drones that teach
lessons from scripts and all testing shall be standardized.
</p>

<p>
I rememer the first time I saw a progarm like this - it was the CISCO
Networking Academy. Teachers trained for a few weeks in the summer and
the course was basically run via computer based tutorials. I can't
speak for it nationally but in my experience, what the students
learned was superficial - very test oriented and there was no value
added by the teacher - even after years of "teaching" the
classes. There's a reason why the few networking lessons in our System
Programming class are called "CISCO in an hour." The kids learn more
in those couple of lessons than in a year of the CISCO curriculum. 
</p>

<p>
Who was to blame? Cisco? They were trying to do something good. The
teacher? Partially, after time they should have learned something of
networking but they were very much out of their element having started
the process from zero tech experience. 
</p>

<p>
The fact is, that got a "Computer Networking" class into the
schools. It might have been meant as a stop-gap until we could get
real Computer Networking teachers hired or trained but it ended up
being good enough. The end result – bad classes and students not
learning what they could.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
So here we are back again at the "let's take non CS teachers, give
them some PD and we'll be good." Rather than take the time to solve
the CS Education problem, we're going to throw down a curriculum, do
some PD and say that it will buy us time. The truth is, however, that
we're going to say "look, we have CS in the schools" and it will be
good enough. 
</p>

<p>
I'd argue, though that for CS, good enough is particularly
dangerous. It's very easy to work through a scripted and coached
program and end up with kids thinking they know some real CS and have
a real product yet having not really learned the subject. This won't
be exposed until later, when they're gone and in college. I predict
that unless something changes, these efforts and similar ones will
drive up the  number of people who after this exposure will say they
love CS but once they get hit over the head with "funcitonal
programming in HASKELL" or whatever real CS they see in college,
they'll drop like flies.

The other day, <a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">Fred Wilson</a> sent out a short tweet storm turned <a href="http://avc.com/2015/02/is-this-a-good-startup-idea/">post</a> on
determining if an entrepreneur's startup idea is a good one. It's
short. Take a minute to read it over.
</p>

<p>
At its core, the post and the comments talk about belief in an idea
and it got me thinking about some things as an educator.
</p>

<p>
Tweet 7:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
and you have to believe in yourself and your idea or nobody else ever will
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
resonated with me, not just in terms of a startup idea, but with
respect to one's passion. 
</p>

<p>
As a CS teacher we get to shepherd kids through projects big and
small. The best work invariably comes from when the kids take an idea
they're passionate about and run with it. Sometimes I can guide the
kids to an idea and it works out well but when the kids end up working
on the stock project the results are less spectacular. 
</p>

<p>
Once the kids buy into a great idea, the educator has to create a
framework for success - give the kids the tools and set up the safety
nets when things don't go as planned.
</p>

<p>
I've never liked all those student entrepreneurs programs – make a
business for the sake of making a business - much better to help guide
the kids towards something they're passionate about and help them run
with it. That's when great things happen.
</p>

<p>
The neat thing is that it's not limited to classes. CSTUY is having
its first hackathon in a few weeks; <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">def hacks():</a>. One of my juniors
came to me with the idea - she got a couple more kids on board and
we're off to the races. I've done some things behind the scenes to
make sure we don't have any real problems but the awesome thing is
that the event is all on the kids.
</p>

<p>
In a way, I'd imagine that Fred, as a VC, once he invests, his role is to
help create the framework for success. I'd also imagine that the
best way to do that is similar to what a great teacher does - bring
out the best in the student, make them aware of pitfalls and be a
supportive mentor.
</p>

<p>
On a deeper level, as teachers, we get to work with young people as
they're developing their own passions. This was something else that I
started thinking about after reading Fred's tweet storm, in particular
tweet 9:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
because I never want someone telling me they wasted five years of
their life on something because I told them it was a good idea
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Teachers are role models and the best teachers are passionate about
their subject and their craft. One of the things I'm most proud of is
the number of friends, former students, who have told me that I gave
them a career, I introduced them to their passion. Sometimes, though,
we miss. I've seen some kids come through my program and leave loving
CS but it was, at least in part, an illusion. I work with a great team
and sometimes loving classes can stand in for loving a subject. 
</p>

<p>
I was talking to my daughter when she was a senior at Stuy and she
commented that she was missing all the subjects she loved one day when
she had to leave early. She included math. I said "since when do you
love math?" She respond "I meant I love math class." That makes sense
she had an amazing teacher. 
</p>

<p>
So, at times, kids leave us for college and then they might discover
that they don't love CS as much as they thought they did. 
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not overly concerned with our misses here since I think we do
better than most in showing CS and Tech for what it is and we always
leave the kids with a great set of mental and practical tools but
every now and then I see a kid who is doing well in the tech industry
and in my gut I feel that the world missed out on a great author,
chemist, or doctor.
</p>

<p>
So, I've rambled on this long enough - just some food for thought from
a teacher.

I'm a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I'm lamenting what
the city's becoming. 
</p>

<p>
New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the
city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores,
sole proprieterships. You could become a "regular." I'm reminded of
Tom Shachman's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Around-The-Block-Business-Neighborhood/dp/0151000778">Around the Block</a> which looks at the businesses
around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now. If you can get your
hands on the book. It's worth a read.
</p>

<p>
In any event, here's a story:
</p>

<p>
Yesterday. JonAlf and I were at the Apple store on Fifth avenue talking about
<a href="http://cstuy.org/">CSTUY</a>. We had four of our talented students presenting their work.
</p>

<p>
After the event, JonAlf had gone and one of our student presenters had
left with his parents. I was left with our other three presenters.
</p>

<p>
I told them that I'd love to take them by this amazing chocolate shop
a few blocks away and I had to explain why:
</p>

<p>
<img src="http:/img/myzels/candy.jpg" alt="candy.jpg">]]
</p>


<p>
A number of years ago, after a morning in Central Park, Batya, Natan,
and I were winding our way home. We ended up passing <a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's
Chocolates</a> on the south side of 55th street between fifth and sixth
avenue. That's when we met Kamila, the shop owner. We chatted for a
while got some chocolate and went on our way. Kamila was amazingly
warm and sincere and the chocolates really really good. I noted that
we would have to return.
</p>

<p>
<img src="http:/img/myzels/kamila.jpg" alt="kamila.jpg">]]
</p>


<p>
That didn't happen until months later but when it did, I was shocked
that Kamila remembered us, what we were doing that day and we just
picked up the conversation where we left off.
</p>

<p>
This pattern repeated over the years. We didn't get to that
neighborhood and thus Myzel's often, but whenever we did, we had to
stop by. Great candies from a truly special person.
</p>

<p>
Alas, my schedule has been such that I hadn't been back to Myzel's in
years. I think three or four. 
</p>

<p>
Now, I was with Nadia, Miranda, and Leslie - three of my incredibly
talented students. They just did an awesome job presenting their work
and I figured I could give them some thank you chocolate as well as
visit one of my  favorite places in the city.
</p>

<p>
I told them that Kamila probably wouldn't remember me but I recounted
my story of Myzel's and how amazing Kamila and the store were. I got
the feeling that they didn't believe me when I told them about Kamila
and the store.
</p>

<p>
We got to Myzel's went in and started to place our order. When Kamila
came out, her first word to me was "professor…" and we picked up
where we left off. As usual, she was charming and sincere. We
reminisced and chatted and then we were off.
</p>

<p>
In a city that's fast becoming cookie cutter we need more places like
<a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's</a> and more people like Kamila.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately rents are rapidly dispatching shops like <a href="http://www.myzels.com/">Myzel's</a> and
people like Kamila are few and far between.
</p>

<p>
So, when you're around City Center or midtown in general, please treat
yourself. You won't be disappointed.

<p>
When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little
rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and
projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.
</p>

<p>
I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again
and ramps them up to speed.
</p>

<p>
In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and
then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.
</p>

<p>
I also remind the kids to self assess where they are and how they've
developed as a programmer. 
</p>

<p>
I get a little tired of education "experts" espousing nonsense like you
have to have each talk each day or that you need to assess each kid
multiple times a period. That's nonsense. With 34 kids in a 40 minute
class and 150 kids a day, that doesn't fly. Besides, so many concepts
take time to develop, learn, and absorb. 
</p>

<p>
Yes, you can get some instant and short term feedback but a lot more
is revealed over time.
</p>

<p>
I'm attaching a small sampling of their homework assignments. It was
basically a one day assignment to do something fun with the HTML5
canvas and indeed, it looks like they had fun.
</p>

<p>
I asked the kids to reflect on what they did now and what they could
do a semester, two, and three semesters ago.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning they would have had no idea how to approach any of
these. A year ago, they would be a major project. Now, they can knock
these out as a homework assignment. 
</p>

<p>
Once you take a step back to look at how much a student can grow in a
year or so you have to marvel at the results.
</p>

<p>
At a place like Stuy, the kids frequently and unfairly judge themselves against
super prodigies. 
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping by looking back at what they could do then vs now they'll
appreciate how awesome they are.

Yesterday, I took part in a round table discussion on Ed Tech and Tech
Ed, the latter being more, as they say, my wheelhouse. Afterwards a
few of us were chatting and a friend observed that when she first
started to talk to high school kids she was shocked that they really
didn't know the local tech players - neither names nor companies.
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, another friend was helping me organize an event for
high schoolers. He started to go down a list of well known tech names
and was surprised when I told him that the kids wouldn't know them.
</p>

<p>
The first time I experienced this, it was just as big a surprised to
me. I was setting up a big high school event at Foursquare (<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2012/03/31/checking-in-with-family.html#.VLfzl9-c1CU">post here</a>)
and was shocked to learn that practically non of the attendees had
heard of the company.
</p>

<p>
This would never have been the case in the 90s or even the early
2000s. What happened?
</p>

<p>
I have a theory.
</p>

<p>
I don't think it's just due to the fact that CS is a hot subject
now. It was hot during the 90's bubble. I'm sure the fact that a wider
range of kids are being exposed to CS is part of this phenomenon but
I don't think it's the biggest reason.
</p>

<p>
I think CS kids back then knew more – more of the players, more of the
tools, more about the systems because they had to. In some ways, and I
know I'm vastly overstating things, it's "too easy" now.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, if you wanted to put your thoughts on line you had
to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>learn html
</li>
<li>maybe some PHP, Perl, or Python
</li>
<li>You probably had to learn a bit about hosting a server
</li>
<li>you had to deal with registering a domain name
</li>
<li>and more
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, you just go to blogger or tumblr. 
</p>

<p>
Back then, if you wanted to communicate, you had to learn how to learn
the dark art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a>, now you have Google chat.
</p>

<p>
Back then, you want to share photos, you had to learn how to make a
gallery. Now, Facebook.
</p>

<p>
And of course the list goes on. 
</p>

<p>
Even programming required that you know something about the filesystem
and the basics of working in an operating system. Now between IDEs
both local and cloud based, you can learn all about programming and
never actually create a stand alone program that operates outside of
the IDE sandbox.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, if a kid was into CS they had to learn more than
just the in class toolset and this in turn forced them to be in touch
with the tech community both products and players.
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying the "good old days" were in fact that good and I love
most of the progress we've made. Just noting the cultural difference. 
</p>

<p>
It means we should pay more attention to educating our classes on tech
culture, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
