I've been planning to put together a response to <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a>'s
recent post - <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html">Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality</a>. 
</p>

<p>
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
</p>

<p>
Before getting to "does it matter," I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent <a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc">IOI results</a> and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we're doing fine.
</p>

<p>
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country's producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don't encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team. 
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I've known some very smart and talented individuals
who've excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I've known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn't call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they're not the ones
who've gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they're not necessarily the ones who've
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
I don't argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they're only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock's laws of startups - <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">law 9</a>).
</p>


<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">
<img width="30%" src="http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like <a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/">Dream it. Code it. Win it.</a>, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
</p>

<p>
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They'll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I'd love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I'd also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools. 
</p>

<p>
I also think there's a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
</p>

<p>
I'm working on building Hunter College's honors CS program and while I
can't move the Hunter curriculum, I'm seeking that balance in my own
way.
</p>

<p>
Will we get there? I don't know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we'll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we'll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn't be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won't do much, however for the
rest of the students. I'm not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there's a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don't seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won't become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon.

Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy's intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don't recommend it in many
cases.
</p>

<p>
Scheme certainly isn't mainstream. That's not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It's less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I've had a student with a background in Scheme, they've been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class. 
</p>

<p>
I like scheme because it's simple. It looks different than other
languages but is <code>(+ 3 4)</code> really that different than <code>add(3,4)</code> or
<code>3+4</code>? 
</p>

<p>
We can tell kids "everything's a function." While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn't, it's close enough for our
purposes. Everything's a function and the way we write a function is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">f</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Apply function <b><b>f</b></b> on arguments <b><b>b c …</b></b>. So we have <code>(+ 2 3)</code> to
add 2 and 3, <code>(and a b)</code> for logical and <code>(= 3 4)</code> to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In scheme, it would be:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">&gt; </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="mi">5</span>
  <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Even though we're fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="nv">add2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
where <code>(lambda (a b) (+ a b))</code> returns a function that adds <b><b>a</b></b> and
<b><b>b</b></b> and <code>define</code> associates it with the identifier <b><b>add2</b></b>. Now we
can use the function: <code>(add2 5 10)</code> which evaluates to 15.
</p>

<p>
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it's off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
Of course this wouldn't work had DrScheme (now <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
</p>

<p>
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
</p>

<p>
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn't as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
</p>

<p>
It also didn't hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
</p>

<p>
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don't get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrapworld</a>
is a terrific program).
</p>

<p>
In any event, if you're a high school CS teacher and  haven't played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.

I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of "why don't you start them with Javascript?" 
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I'd get similar pushback but then it
was "why not Java?", "why not C?", or "whu not C++?"
</p>

<p>
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don't like Javascript as a first language and I thought I'd share some
of them here. I'll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
</p>

<p>
To start, let me say that I <b><b>Love</b></b> Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
</p>

<p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ubiquity and availability:

<p>
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it's also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Interactivity:

<p>
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
</p>
</li>

<li>It's mainstream
</li>

<li>It's quick to get up and running
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
</p>

<p>
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like <a href="http://www.drjava.org/">DrJava</a>, <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a>, and
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven't found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There's no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
</p>

<p>
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
</p>

<p>
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have <code>=</code>, and <code>==</code>
which is pretty conventional, but then there's also <code>===</code>. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">53</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//  50</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
For more, check out the this <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">video</a>. Start watching at about 1:20 -
it's a riot.
</p>

<p>
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript's got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it's easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
</p>

<p>
Finally, the fact that Javascript's a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who've at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
"everyone knows this but me." A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
</p>

<p>
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It's just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.

One of my favorite but little used emacs features is rectangular
editing. It's little used because I don't need it all that often. It's
one of my favorites because when I do need it, it's just so amazingly
useful.
</p>

<p>
The idea is you can mark a rectangle of text, cut it and later paste
it.  This means that if you have three columns of text:
</p>

<pre class="example">
a b c
d e f
g h i
j k l
</pre>

<p>
You can easily mark the middle column (b e h k) or even just the b e
and h, cut it and paste it elsewhere as a rectangle. You can also open
up a rectangular region (filled with whitespace). There are a couple
of other niceties but that's the basic idea.

Here's a link to all the functions:

I'm guessing my views  on this aren't very popular -that's OK, every
community needs a curmudgeon.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren't careful, once the big
players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and
not in a good way. It looks like indeed we're well on our way down
that road.
</p>

<p>
I've ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer
programs. <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-07-learning-takes-time.html/#.WJXSS99vHmE">STEM Oil Salesmen</a> <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.1">1</a></sup>
selling easy fixes, exciting kids and parents, using the Think Method
just like Professor Harold Hill only to send the kids off where they
can blame a future teacher for failure.
</p>

<p>
I've also ranted about teacher preparation and how all the rage is
short term, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/scotland/#.WJXT999vHmE">Superficial PD and scripted curricula</a>  and my concern that   
once the politicians can say CS is in the schools, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-03-04-expedient-vs-good.html/#.WJXT7d9vHmE">we'll be done</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my
career and while it's wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal,
I'm seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming
reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing
and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to
teachers and students.
</p>

<p>
The other week I noticed, <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156278055294/ap-cs-principles-could-make-history-how-can-we">this post</a> by Code.org trying to encourage
more students to take the APCSP exam - not encourage more students
take the class or some other class or to have more students be exposed
to CS but to actually sit for the APCSP exam. That post was followed
by <a href="http://teacherblog.code.org/post/156689658029/ask-your-cs-principles-students-to-star-in-our">this one</a> which also highlights actually taking the exam.
</p>

<p>
This didn't sit well with me. 
</p>

<p>
What does the exam do for the kid? It doesn't drive instruction - by
that time, any good teacher knows their student and is better served
by using their own <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.WJXbA99vHmE">assessments</a>. The college credit thing? I'm
skeptical. Fewer and fewer schools are giving credit for APCSA let
alone this new CS0 non major course. Blanket credit? Since full time
students pay for a range of credits, I'm still skeptical
here. Placement? It's a course for non-majors - what exactly are you
placing out of?
</p>

<p>
Reasons not to take the exam?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it doesn't do anything for the kid, why take it
</li>
<li>Stress of taking the exam
</li>
<li>There are other ways of placing out of courses once in college
</li>
<li>Save the expense
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a general rule, I'm against forcing students to sit for
AP exams. At the extreme case, since we've been brainwashed to think
that a school that has lots of kids sitting for exams is good, I've
seen at least one case of a principal having all his kids sit for, and
just about all <b><b>fail</b></b> AP Calculus - that is, get a 1 or 2 on the exam. This
principal had all his students take the exam, and only 2 scores were 3
or higher. This principal then parlayed his success into a higher
profile gig - he's moved up in the world while setting up his students
to fail.
</p>

<p>
This follows last year's announcement that code.org was <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/#.WJXbm99vHmE">partnering with
the College Board</a> - offering PD to teachers for free if the schools
signed up their students for the PSAT 8/9 - another meaningless
exam. So, we get teacher training light <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.2">2</a></sup> as long as the school pays for
the PSAT8/9 for every kid so that the kid can take yet another test
with really no value<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Why should students pay for an AP exam that doesn't do anything for
them? Why should Jane Q Taxpayer pay for exams that only server to
enrich the College Board.
</p>

<p>
True, The College Board is a big player. They already have much more
influence of American High School education than they should. It's
easy to climb on board the AP train for entre into our schools. The
question is, should we use positions of influence to push efforts that
might help our end but leave collateral damage to students and the public.
</p>

<p>
I don't doubt code.org's sincerity in wanting good CS in all schools
nor the efforts or value as an advocate for CS Education. I'm
concerned that the desire to win big and win now is moving us in a
direction that we'll regret years from now.

Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this
site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are
directly related to education. 
</p>

<p>
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has
provided a reason to break with that tradition.
</p>

<p>
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have
already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked  about the behavior of our
President and government.
</p>

<p>
Long time blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Dave Winer</a> put together <a href="http://trumpstatus.org/">trumpstatus.org</a> where he's
collecting many of the issues that we're all so alarmed with.
</p>

<p>
I would add cabinet appointments to his list with my particular
personal concern over DeVos and the department of education. I've been
meaning to blog about that for a while - perhaps this week.
</p>


<p>
My concern for today is something else. Every day, I see a new Trump
induced crisis and every day I see a different subset of my circles
respond. It's not quite as bad as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
</p>

<p>
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
People are indeed speaking out, but I am concerned that people
are going to rise up for their personal issue and when placated go
back to business as usual - this is <b><b>NOT</b></b> the time for business as
usual.
</p>

<p>
With the ACA repeal, I saw concerns from my working class friends and
friends that work with lower earning populations. 
</p>

<p>
Going into the DeVos hearing, mostly educators - real educators not
astroturf reformers. 
</p>

<p>
With Friday's order, the whole tech community came out.
</p>

<p>
Here's part of a thread by tech activist <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash">Anil Dash</a> calling out,
calling on, and crediting assorted tech players.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

We have to remember that all these order, policies, appointments, and
plans are coming from the same place - Donald Trump and those
politicians that are enabling him.
</p>

<p>
If he backs off on immigration, education issues remain, if he backs
off there, we still have ACA, if that eases up, what about Women's
rights and on and on.
</p>

<p>
This means we all have to get involved and stay involved. 
</p>

<p>
What have I been doing?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I finally joined the ACLU and set up a monthly donation.
</li>
<li>I subscribed to <a href="https://dailyaction.org">Daily Action</a> so that I get a reminder each day of
someone I can call to make a difference.
</li>
<li>I'm starting to accumulate my representatives phone numbers as I
make those calls and am trying to make at least a call a day to
remind our representatives who they work for.
</li>
<li>Education and advocacy
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you suggestions for me - please post them here.
</p>

<p>
Thus ends my not business as usual post. What's going on in America is
not someone else's problem - it's all of our problem and we all have
to be active and vigilant to make it through tough times to come.

While I use emacs for all all sorts of things, one of the things I
haven't done much is run shells from within emacs. I'm not sure
why. I'm a command line wonk and adding command line goodness and
emacs together seems like a natural. Maybe it's because back in the
day I spent a lot of time on MS-DOS systems. You could get a
reasonable Unixy facsimile using tools like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_Toolkit">MKS toolkit</a> and I like
so many other young computer scientists wrote our own small shells
when we learned C so I used that insted of command.com. 
</p>

<p>
In any event, I'm trying to use the shell within emacs more. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick video showing both <b><b>shell</b></b>, which runs whatever your
default shell is in an emacs buffer and <b><b>eshell</b></b> which is emacs own
shell.
</p>

<p>
I use a couple of packages to smooth over a couple of things.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el">Virtuelenvwrapper</a> smooths things voer with the python virtaulenv and
virtualenvwrapper linux packages:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">virtualenvwrapper</span>
      <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
      <span class="nv">:config</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">venv-initialize-interactive-shells</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">venv-initialize-eshell</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Only relevant if you use Python and virtualenvs.
</p>

<p>
and more importantly, <a href="https://github.com/killdash9/better-shell">better shell</a>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">better-shell</span>
    <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
cleans things up when using a termianl to connect to a remote machine.
</p>

<p>
If you use a shell from within emacs as part of your workflow, please
post how, or better, make a video!!!!

    <p>
What essential topics should we teach in our intro courses? This seems
to be a recurring topic recently. 
</p>

<p>
It can be an important topic but, unfortunately, too often, it seems
that people have too myopic a view
</p>

<p>
I remember thinking about this years ago when APCS moved from C++ to
Java. Both languages have good and bad points both for practical and
educational use. A big loss in the move to Java was memory management
and the topics you could cover when memory issues arose. 
</p>

<p>
Of course one might say that memory management shouldn't be in the
first year of CS. That's fine, as long as you put it back in somewhere
later on - something that didn't seem to happen universally. 
</p>

<p>
That's the myopic view - far too few look at the overall picture.
</p>

C++ to Java ended up in removing a topic. I've also seen the reverse. 
I was talking to a friend about intro topics. He told me that it was
critical to cover (insert topic here) in an intro course. Why, I
asked? Because the kids absolutely needed to know that material in the
third year course he was teaching.
</p>

<p>
I pressed a bit – "how many kids actually remember (insert topic
here) and do you have to reteach anything." The answer - pretty much
no one remembered and he always retaught the subject.
</p>

<p>
Did this mean that no one taught the topic in the earlier class?
Unlikely. More likely is that the topic was taught without purpose or
context, just because it was supposed to be taught and thus the
knowledge wasn't retained. Sounds to me like the topic wasn't in the
right place to begin with. Maybe it should have just been taught in
that 300 level course to begin with.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw">Alfred Thompson</a> wrote a post earlier today asking about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/01/how-important-are-number-bases-for-pre.html">teaching
number bases</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Is it important? Maybe. Is it essential for an intro course? Probably
not. 
</p>

<p>
Binary makes sense when you start talking about low level stuff. If
your intro course never gets close to the machine then why muddy the water
with a topic that's out of place. The topic probably won't be
appreciated and retention and understanding will be low. 
</p>

<p>
If your intro course gets close to the machine or if you decide to
talk about compiled code or similar topics, you have an entre to talk
binary which leads to the convenience of hexadecimal. At Stuyvesant,
it was much more sensible to talk about number bases in our systems
course when we looked at C code in a debugger rather than in our intro
our AP course. 
</p>

<p>
You also might work on some application where bitmaps or similar as
useful. That might be another good time to talk about number bases.
</p>

<p>
Is it important for a CS person to understand binary and it's relation
to digital computers? Certainly. Does it have to be studied day one?
Certainly not.
</p>

<p>
We need to keep an eye on the big picture. You can't get everything
into a single class or a single yea. The question to ask is - do our students know what they have to by the time they
leave our charge?

A while ago I did a couple of videos on how I use org-capture
(<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-23-capture-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-24-capture-2/">part 2</a>). I didn't get into a big part of org-capture - how I
use org-mode and capture to manage my calendar and todo lists.
</p>

<p>
I was waiting to see if I liked my current setup - using <a href="https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el">org-gcal</a> to
sync with my Google Calendar for appointments while using my main org
file for my todo list.
</p>

<p>
Coincidentally, Rainer König recently put up a video on how he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIzzjSaq2N8&amp;list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&amp;index=33">syncs
with his Google calendar</a>. He uses a different method than the one I
present in this video so make sure to check out his approach. In fact,
you should check out his entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE">series on org-mode</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code I use install org-gcal. The video steps through
setting up things on the Google side. You'll have to replace the
<b><b>client ID</b></b> and <b><b>client secrets</b></b> in the code below as well as use
your calendar name and whatever org file you want to sync with.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-check-signature</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">org-gcal</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-gcal-client-id</span> <span class="s">"oauth 2.0 client ID"</span>
	<span class="nv">org-gcal-client-secret</span> <span class="s">"client secret"</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
I use these two hooks to sync things semi-automatically. The first
hook syncs whenever I load the agenda. Since this happens in the
background, if I just added something to my calendar, I might have to
reload the agenda by hitting <b><b>r</b></b> in the agenda view. 
</p>

<p>
The second hook syncs with my Google calendar when I capture.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-agenda-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-gcal-sync</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-capture-after-finalize-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-gcal-sync</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Here are the rest of my settings. The org files I want to include in
my agenda views:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>gcal.org – the one I'm syncing
</li>
<li>i.org – my main org file for todo items (the todo capture places
things in here)
</li>
<li>schedule.org – my old schedule before I was syncing with
Google. Not active anymore. I should probably remove it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, my capture settings:

<p>
The end result is that I can add an event in my Google calendar (or
accept a calendar invite) and it appears in my org-mode
agenda. Likewise, I can add a scheduled event using capture and it
will sync up to Google. I can also just add an event by editing
gcal.org but then would have to run <b><b>org-gcal-post-at-point</b></b> to send
it up to Google.
</p>

<p>
Now, I can use bring up a regular agenda <b><b>C-a a</b></b>, my todo list <b><b>C-a
t</b></b> or by adding a custom agenda command:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-custom-commands</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">"c"</span> <span class="s">"Simple agenda view"</span>
	 <span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">agenda</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">)</span>
	  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">alltodo</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">)))))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
a combined agenda and todo view using <b><b>C-a n</b></b>
</p>


<p>
Finally, there's <a href="https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw">calfw</a>. It's a nice tool to view calendars in
Google. I don't use it much anymore but it is nice:
