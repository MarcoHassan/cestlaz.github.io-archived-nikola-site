I'll be traveling for the next couple of weeks so I probably won't
have time for another video until mid to late July. I'll probably
write a post about this series and do some regular blogging over that
time but probably no new videos for a couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
Also, a couple of notes about the series:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Instead of making a separate git branch for each episode, I'm just
adding on to the master branch on GitHub. If you're not familiar
with Git and GitHub don't worry about this. Hardly anyone will
notice a difference.
</li>
<li>If this theme doesn't show well on video, please let me know, I'll
change it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ok, now to this installments video.
</p>

<p>
It talks about using org-mode to store our emacs init file.
</p>

<p>
The first key is that you can put code-blocks in org-mode:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(emacs-lisp code goes here)
(more emacs lisp goes here)
(and you can have even more here)
#+END_SRC
</pre></div>

<p>
Since it's elisp you can run the individual line using the usual <b><b>C-x C-e</b></b>
but you can run the entire block by placing your cursor anywhere in
the block and typing <b><b>C-c C-c</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
One minor annoyance about editing code blocks is that it doesn't do
syntax highlighting or auto indentation. To solve this, emacs lets you
pull up an editing buffer by typing <b>*C-c '*</b>. 
</p>

<p>
You're supposed to be able to save your changes with <b>*C-c '*</b> again
or <b><b>C-x C-s</b></b> and kill the buffer without saving changes with <b><b>C-x
C-k</b></b> 
but the version of org-mode that came with my version of emacs
didn't support it - I had to install a newer version of org-mode from
melpa. 
</p>

<p>
I couldn't figure out how to do this via use-package, but if this
problem happens to you, you can just type <b><b>Alt-x package-install</b></b>
and then type <b><b>org</b></b> and hit enter to install it.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, you might have to reload emacs but then everything
should work. 
</p>

<p>
This lets us move most of our configuration to a separate file. We're
calling it <b><b>myinit.org</b></b> and storing it in our .emacs.d
directory. You can use any name <b><b>except</b></b> init.org as I mentioned in
the video.
</p>

<p>
The file's a little big so here's a link to it:
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org">https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Notice how GitHub formats it to look all nice.
</p>

<p>
Here's the raw file so you can see the gory details:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Since we're loading the file in overview mode, when we load it in
emacs we see:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">interface</span> <span class="nv">tweaks</span>

<span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">Autocomplete</span>
<span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">Themes</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We can tab open and close each section and add text to clarify things
around the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
All that's left in <b><b>init.el</b></b> is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-enable-at-startup</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">'package-archives</span>
	     <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"melpa"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">"https://melpa.org/packages/"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-initialize</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; Bootstrap `use-package'</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">unless</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-installed-p</span> <span class="ss">'use-package</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-refresh-contents</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-install</span> <span class="ss">'use-package</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-babel-load-file</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">expand-file-name</span> <span class="s">"~/.emacs.d/myinit.org"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
With the last line performing the magic of loading our org file and
running all the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we added a couple of small interface changes:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fset</span> <span class="ss">'yes-or-no-p</span> <span class="ss">'y-or-n-p</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">kbd</span> <span class="s">"&lt;f5&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">'revert-buffer</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The first line lets us type y or n instead of yes or no and the second
let's us reload a file into our current buffer using the <b><b>f5</b></b> key.
</p>

    <p>
Yesterday I read over Hillary's briefing on her initiative on
<a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/">Technology and Innovation</a>.
</p>

<p>
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she's pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
</p>

<p>
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don't want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
</p>

<p>
Some initial responses from the education community is "what about
young teachers, don't they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…" and of course they're right. On the other hand, I
don't want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That's the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
</p>

<p>
But again, that's not where I'm going with this.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with "who are these founders?" I don't have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so. 
</p>

<p>
This alone makes Hillary's plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
</p>

<p>
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
"explore similar incentives"  for early employees, citing "10 to 20."
This doesn't seem right to me.
</p>

<p>
Now let's look further into the benefits. I don't know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I've seen a bunch of
figures including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>90% of startups fail within the first three years
</li>
<li>Three out of four startups fail 
</li>
<li>Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
others turn a profit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't know where the truth lies but I'd imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
</p>

<p>
Hillary's plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
</p>

<p>
I've always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
</p>

<p>
So there it is. A plan that makes for great "press release" but is it
really addressing the issues?

Yesterday over at <a href="http://avc.com">AVC</a> Fred blogged about the AFSE graduation and
posted a <a href="http://avc.com/2016/06/afse-commencement-speech/">transcript of the speech he gave</a>. It's well worth a read.
</p>

<p>
Some of the comments touched on mentors and role models so I though
I'd talk a little about that here.
</p>

<p>
I've always believed that as a parent, modeling - that is, how we
behave is one of the largest shapers of our kids. It's one thing to
take your kid to a museum because that's what you should do as a good
parent and another if you think - "I wants to go to that museum and
damn it, I'm taking you along." I'm no psychologist but my gut tells
me the former is good but the latter is better. 
</p>

<p>
This of course extends to schools. As teachers we deliver instruction
but we also communicate through how we behave. Students are very
perceptive and we can have influences that we don't even know. I
remember a parent who thanked me because their child started
exercising and being more active because of me. It's not something I
ever talked to the kid about but I would run after my classes at Stuy,
ride to school and in class I might give an exercise anecdote or
two. Just by doing something healthy and positive where kids can see
it led to some good.
</p>

<p>
Now, as teachers, we have limited reach and just as in many cases
where a child won't listen to a parent and needs a friendly teacher to
weigh in, there are plenty of times a student won't really listen to a
teacher, particularly in CS. Most CS teachers don't have extensive CS
backgrounds and self taught kids frequently feel they know more. Even
when a student believes that a CS teacher's got the goods, they're
skeptical - teaching as a profession has been so beaten up many
students will have a ""so why are you teaching and not working at
Google" attitude.
</p>

<p>
Even with the best intentions from parents and teachers, for many students,
particularly those from poor backgrounds there are limits to our
influence. If a parent has to work multiple jobs at crazy hours, they
have less time to be a positive role model. If they've never been to
college or worked in a white collar profession they won't have the
connections and resources to effectively guide their child through the
education to profession maze.
</p>

<p>
This is where mentors and role models become so important.
</p>

<p>
For me, I first saw this when I was a young teacher. My graduates
hadn't gotten to the real world yet and I hadn't developed a
reputation. I'd have friends come in to give tech and industry
talks. What I found was that in addition to being inspirational, it
help authenticate me as being legit. When they would talk about a best
practice that I had already taught them, the classes got the idea that
maybe I did know a thing or two about this CS stuff.
</p>

<p>
You could see the impact when we held <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-03-31-checking-in-with-family.html/#.V3Qkkx9vGAk">"Tech speed dating" events</a> where
I mixed current high school students with professionals.
</p>

<p>
So many comments afterwards like "I didn' know I could do that in CS,"
"now I know what I want to do…." Slam dunk!!
</p>

<p>
Of course, you have to curate your volunteers. While a guest talk from
a very senior, very established adult can be inspiring some times,
they can be so far removed from the kids next steps, it can actually
be intimidating and a turn off. As a side note, I don't think that
this would be the case at all with respect to Fred's graduation
speech. His overall sincerity and the fact that he's so connected to
the school and known to the kids made sure of that.
</p>

<p>
When I made my first Hunter college event, I wanted to kick start and
excite the current students and also give myself some CS street cred so
I carefully selected the participants for our first panel / mixer. I
had:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A young VC
</li>
<li>A mid 30s CTO of a mid size company
</li>
<li>A mid 30s Facebook engineer who also spent time at Google
</li>
<li>Assorted recent college grad tech people from big companies, start ups,
and everything in between.
</li>
<li>I tried to have a diverse crowd.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted a couple of more senior people to show the end of the road
but I wanted most of the people there to be at "the next rung in the
ladder." All indications were that the event was also a slam dunk.
</p>

<p>
Through all of this it's become pretty apparent to me that bringing in
adult mentors and role models can be even more important than covering
every little bit of whatever curriculum you're teaching.  Some people
say that we need more female High School CS teachers and while I agree
with that sentiment, I'd rather have the best CS teacher I can get
regardless of background as long as I have amazing women in tech to
provide for my students as role models. 
</p>

<p>
This led me to think about a couple of the CS Ed programs that I
support. TEALS and ScriptEd. I like both, but they're different
models. In TEALS the volunteer works with the teacher. In ScriptEd,
the volunteer is the teacher. I have many former students that have
volunteered through TEALS but I don't know any who've done SciptEd so
I don't have the same "inside" info. 
</p>

<p>
For TEALS, those volunteers are also role models. Every day that Etsy
engineer is in the classroom those students see and hear from a tech
professional. What's more, they see and hear from one who's taking the
time to be with them.
</p>

<p>
Of course the same is true for ScriptEd but I wonder if after some
time the students view the ScriptEd volunteer as the teacher rather
than the tech professional.
</p>

<p>
There's probably some interesting research in there.
</p>

<p>
Finally nothing is better than really being able to hook kids up with
long term mentors. This is something that I think AFSE's been able to
do but it's an expensive proposition. It's something I'd love to see
more of at schools and as part of the basic budget but with all the
money wasted on things like standardized testing and flawed teacher
evaluation systems, I don't see it coming any time soon.

Now that we have a nice basic configuration, let's make Emacs look a
little nicer.
</p>

<p>
Like most editors, Emacs can be extensively themed. 
</p>

<p>
As shown in the video, you can quickly see the built in themes using
the <b><b>customize-themes</b></b> command.
</p>

<p>
You can load one of these themes by using the <b><b>load-theme</b></b> command
interactively or, more likely by putting:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">'leuven</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
in your init.el. The above code loads the built in <b><b>leuven</b></b> theme.
</p>

<p>
I prefer the <b><b>zenburn</b></b> theme. For that, you have to load the zenburn
package. Here's the code in our init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">zenburn-theme</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">'zenburn</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In the video, I also mention the color theme package.
</p>

<p>
So, customize away.
</p>

<p>
In the links, you'll find some links to some Emacs theme gallery sites
to help find something you like.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for reading and watching and as always, please leave comments,
suggestions and favorite themes.

Out of the box, Emacs supports various types of completion.
</p>

<p>
Tab completion for filenames and commands basically work right out of
the box and Emacs has built in modes like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode">Abbrev</a>, <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HippieExpand">Hippie Expand</a>, and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dynamic-Abbrevs.html">Dabbrev</a> provide a manner of completion for in buffer text.
</p>

<p>
I briefly show Dabbrev (Dynamic Abbrevs) in the video and if you're
interested in the others, follow the links.
</p>

<p>
We saw ow the built in Ido mode and third party packages like Ivy,
which I prefer, and Helm make for better completions on functions,
filenames, and the like and Emacs also has third party packages for in
buffer completion. 
</p>

<p>
The two main contenders are <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete">auto-complete Mode</a> and <a href="http://company-mode.github.io/%0A">company Mode</a>. I use
auto-complete, others swear by company. The video shows the basics of
auto-complete mode but check both out and decide for yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you feel strongly about one or the other, please share in the
comments.
</p>


<p>
Here's a basic configuration:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">auto-complete</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">progn</span>

    <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We'll modify this as move along in the series.

Here's a really cool navigation method that I've been meaning to use
more. Avy is a replacement for ace-jump mode which is an
implementation of easymotion, a vim plugin.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty cool and lets you quickly navigate to any spot on the
screen.
</p>

<p>
After triggering avy, or more specifically the <b><b>avy-goto-char</b></b>
function, emacs prompts you for a single character. When you type it,
all instances of the character that start out words change to a
highlighted letter. Type the highlighted letter and you jump to that
location.
</p>

<p>
The avy package comes with a bunch of options including a 2 character
search variant, a timed variant which drops into search, and more.
</p>

<p>
The Avy home page has all the details.

I spent last Saturday up at the Microsoft offices in Times Square
observing a <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a> training session. My fried <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielgranor">Nathaniel Granor</a>, Teals
Regional Manager in the east has invited me a number of times and this
time I was able to make it.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know, TEALS is a program that takes volunteers in the
tech industry and places them in classrooms. Unlike other programs,
the TEALS volunteers work with the teachers while the kids learn some
CS. The idea is that the teacher will learn about CS from the
volunteer and the volunteer will learn something about teaching.
</p>

<p>
It's not the same as having a strong, knowledgeable CS teacher in the
classroom but until we get there, TEALS is doing great work giving
kids something that they need and otherwise wouldn't get.
</p>

<p>
At one point, Nathaniel started to talk to the volunteers about lesson
plans emphasizing the fact that TEALS would provide all the lesson materials and
the plans so these new to teaching tech volunteers wouldn't have to
make curricular decisions. 
</p>

<p>
The lesson plan form was pretty traditional and pretty formulaic:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>warm up
</li>
<li>hook
</li>
<li>instruction 
</li>
<li>practice
</li>
<li>Assessment
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Very similar to what I was shown back in the day during my two day
"teaching boot camp" that kicked off my career <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/lesson-plans/#fn.1">1</a></sup> and very
appropriate as an effective and efficient way to prepare these
volunteers for their first days. 
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking about my lesson planning over the years.
</p>

<p>
When I started, I was teaching math but I wasn't really a math
guy - I was CS all the way. I had to remember the math from high
school, learn the new topics, and figure out how to teach it.
</p>

<p>
I had a very supportive department but they were busy with their own
classes and this was pre internet. Fortunately, the NYC DOE published
lesson plan books. They were basically bound volumes of xerox copies
of hand written and typed lesson plans provided by experienced
teachers.
</p>

<p>
I spent many hours copying them, studying  them, and then later
tweaking them.
</p>

<p>
They were a life saver back then. How was the teaching? OK. Not
great. I got the material to the kids but I was nothing special. This
is where I started to form my bias against the scripted teaching
that's being pushed down today.
</p>

<p>
As I developed my chops, I started to design my own experiences for my
classes and things improved. By the time I was done teaching math -
maybe 4 years in, I was just scratching the surface of being a math
teacher.
</p>

<p>
One year in, I started teaching CS along with math at Seward
Park. When I was bumped to Stuy, I went back to math for  a year and a
half and then it was all CS all the time.
</p>

<p>
For CS, we didn't have lesson plan books so I had to craft everything
from scratch. It was a lot of work but the results were much better.
</p>

<p>
At first, I would actually write out lesson plans a la math lesson
plans. A "do now," "instructional objectives," "applications,"
"Homework," etc. The only thing I never formally wrote out was a
"medial summary."
</p>

<p>
Over time, my lessons got better but my lesson plans looked worse and
worse. 
</p>

<p>
There were times a lesson plan might look something like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/lesson-plans/plan.jpg" alt="plan.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
OK, not exactly but as I developed at my craft, I didn't need a laid
out script to follow line for line  rather, just a set of little
reminders and maybe some printed out code. If we were going to develop
a complicated algorithm or derivation, though, I would still write out
all the steps.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't mean that as my career progressed I planned any less. It
might appear that I'm winging it but even if little to nothing is
written down, there is a plan and there's always a lot of pre work
before class begins.
</p>

<p>
Now, to bring this back to TEALS.
</p>

<p>
It's interesting how what's good in one context is not so much in
another.
</p>

<p>
What TEALS is doing is great - they've got to get a lot of
technologists in to classrooms quickly but once there, they'll be with
real, hopefully experienced teachers. What they're doing gets them
ready to go. It's a starting point, not an end.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, when I see scripted curriculum being sold as the
special sauce, be it in CS teacher "training," Teach for America
summer prep or in the name of charter school uniformity, I run the
other way.
</p>

<p>
Let's prepare curricular  materials for important programs like TEALS
and for beginning teachers just starting out but let's not confuse a
scripted lesson that can be delivered by one and all to be anything
close to the work of a master educator and craftsman.

The other day my friend and fellow CS Ed Blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a> wrote
about <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/06/better-comments-in-visual-studio.html">Better Comments</a>, an extension for visual studio that displays
comments that are marked up  with special characters in order to
highlight them. Here's a screenshot:

</div>


<p>
So, the first thing I though was "I bet emacs could do that pretty
easily" and down the rabbit hole I went.
</p>

<p>
I had to figure out something about how emacs themes and font-locking
(emacs for syntax highlighting) works and of course spent far too much
time learning about Emacs, my favored tool, rather than getting actual
work done, but I came up with this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-foreground</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span> <span class="s">"#00ff00"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-foreground</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span> <span class="s">"#ff0000"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">make-face</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">set-face-attribute</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span>
		    <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="nv">:strike-through</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">"adds a few special keywords"</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">font-lock-add-keywords</span> 
   <span class="nv">nil</span>
   <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">"cx \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-strike</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ct \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-todo</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ci \\(.+\\)"</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ss">'font-lock-comment-important</span> <span class="nv">prepend</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'js2-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'js-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'add-custom-keyw</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
It's a hack but it does indeed work. In action, it looks something
like this:
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TLw1yOMKMc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Truth be told, it really colors anything following cx, ct, or ci, not
just in comments – I have to look a bit more into how emacs handles
comments to figure that one out.
</p>

<p>
In any event, even though I spent too much time doing this, it's nice
to know I'm working in a tool in which I can.
</p>

This video is all about using incremental search to navigate through your emacs buffers.

<p>
You can use the default incremental searchb, bound to <b><b>C-s</b></b> for
isearch-forward <b><b>C-r</b></b> to search backwards (reverse).
</p>

<p>
They work really well as is but I prefer using <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Swiper</a>. The video demos
both and the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Swiper</a> home page has loads of details.
</p>

<p>
Part of the Swiper package includes ivy and counsel which I use instead of ido.
</p>

<p>
The video also mentions lorem-ipsum mode for generating text quickly and <b><b>describe-mode</b></b> in the help system.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code we added for swiper:

    <p>
I received an email from a friend the other day asking me about a
particular robotics platform she recently saw.
</p>

<p>
I've played with robotics on and off over the years ranging from
building them from (not using) scratch using Atmel chips and programming them in
assembly to using Arduino based platforms to using pre-built robot
platforms. They're really cool and since they interact with the real
world you can do all sorts of interesting and motivational things with students.
</p>

<p>
I've done these on my own as a hobbyist and also with students either
individually or in small groups, but never as part of a class I had
been teaching.
</p>

<p>
Why not?
</p>

<p>
The biggest reason is that the classes I've taught are already so
packed full of CS goodness that we can't even get everything done
that's theoretically on the syllabi.
</p>

<p>
The other has to do with practical concerns.
</p>

<p>
Equipment costs - Let's say we can get our platform at $100 a pop. I
just can't see a public school with 34 kids in a class getting one per
student or one for every two.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the robot to student ratio and how much actual access do
the kids get? If they're designing  building, do they all get to
design and build? Same question with coding and operating.
</p>

<p>
Then there's space – if we're talking about a mobile platform as
opposed to something that sits on the desk and is near stationary, we
have a problem. The classrooms I've taught in can barely hold the
students.
</p>

<p>
There are also issues with breakage, loss, theft and long term
maintainability - will we be able to or even want to fill in with
compatible units in a few years as needed or will we have to reboot
the program from scratch.
</p>

<p>
All that to deal with before we even get to the fun of teaching and learning.
</p>

<p>
I'm really curious about the experiences of those of you who do teach
using robots and similar platforms. 
</p>

<p>
If you are such a teacher, could you please fill out this form or
leave a comment for anything that the form doesn't cover?
