I generally use three email accounts. My personal one, work one, and
one for my non-profit. For a couple of years, I've been using mu4e
under Emacs for both my work and non-profit email accounts and gmail
for my personal account. 
</p>

<p>
I've had lots of requests for a video on what I do but I've been
hesitant for two reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There are parts of my configuration that are copied from others and
I really don't understand.</li>
<li>I wasn't happy with the complexity and some of the tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>
While there are still parts of my configuration that I'm not 100%
clear on I've cleaned up the tooling and complexity by using mu4e only
for my work email for the time being and by switching to mbsync. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a writeup on configuring things with video at the end.
</p>

<p>
Unless you run an email server on your local machine using mu4e can be
thought of as three parts.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get the email from the server to the local machine using IMAP.</li>
<li>Setting up mu.</li>
<li>Access the email locally from Emacs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org296a397">Part 1 Getting the email to your local machine using mbsync</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org296a397">
<p>
I found his terrific blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/robstewartUK">Rob Stewart</a> on setting up <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rs46/posts/2014-01-13-mu4e-email-client.html">mbsync and
mu4e</a>. Read it over. I basically followed his directions for setting up
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/isync/isync/ci/master/tree/">mbsync</a>. To build from source under Linux, I used the sequence:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre></div>

<p>
I followed Rob's instructions basically verbatim for the password and
authentication stuff so I suggest you do the same. 
</p>

<p>
You'll also have to make sure to make the necessary email directories
manually. I describe all of this in the video.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org959dec7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org959dec7">Part 2 - setting up mu.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org959dec7">
<p>
To set up mu, clone it from git://github.com/djcb/mu.git and build
it. You can find dependencies <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Installation.html">here</a> and then follow the same sequence
used to build mbsync listed above.
</p>


<p>
Since I store my local email under a folder <code>Maildir</code>  which is what
mu defaults to I can start using it by indexing my emails:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mu index
</pre></div>

<p>
The video shows some examples of using mu from the command line and
you can look at the mu cheatsheet <a href="http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/cheatsheet.html">here</a>. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org6c6e2c5">Setting up mu4e in emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c6e2c5">
<p>
Finally, you can set up mu4e in emacs. Take a look at Rob's
configuration in his post or my <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/mu4econfig-sample.el">sample</a> config. You'll have to take a
few minutes to go through either and make the appropriate changes but 
the required changes should be cleared.
</p>

<p>
The video goes through all of this and then a brief demo of how I use
mu4e.
</p>

<p>
I'm very happy with it and plan to integrate my non-profit email and
maybe even personal email into it soon.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy:

<p>
In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is
the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool. 
</p>

<p>
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely
tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these
educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to
actually settle in a position.
</p>

<p>
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to
that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically
seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior
was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening
could be found. The Bloomberg plan allowed teachers to use criteria
other than seniority for transfers but so as not to violate the
contract agreed to by both parties, teachers who were excessed, as
they might not be least senior, were kept on as employees and put in
the pool.
</p>

<p>
ATR's would rotate from school to school. Sometimes for a couple of
week but more recently for a year at a time. When at a school for only
a couple of weeks they could only be used as subs or for grunt work
but even when there for a year they're treated like second class
citizens.
</p>

<p>
The ATR pool grew in size when the Bloomberg/Klein DOE went on the war
path, set schools up to fail and closed them left and right. If you
had the bad luck being at a close out school when it closed then, hello
ATR pool.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, the press, ed reformers and politicians have unfairly
bashed this group of educators. They've falsely claimed that these are
criminal teachers or unsatisfactory teachers. That's a blatant
lie. Teachers up on charges are removed from schools and await a
hearing in another draconian process set up to violate teacher's
rights. If a teacher is ultimately found guilty, they are disciplined
or fired. If exonerated, they're returned to their schools. In any
case they're not ATRs. Teachers that are repeatedly found to be
unsatisfactory are likewise removed (although the process here is
ridiculous and unfair as well).
</p>

<p>
ATRs like any pool of teachers run the gamut. Some are great, some are
poor, many will fall in between. All are stigmatized and treated like
damaged goods.
</p>

<p>
People ask, how can a good teacher get into the ATR pool? As I said,
be at a closeout school. In the year before I was able to bring my friend
and former colleague JonAlf over to Stuy, he was at Brandeis High
School - a
closeout school. I tried to bring him over that year but his principal
wouldn't release him. Had I not been successful in bringing him over
the following year he might very well have ended up in the ATR pool
and he's one of the best teachers I know. What about the teacher that
doesn't want to abandon those kids that the DOE abandoned when they
decided to close the school. That martyr teacher surely ends up in the
ATR pool but that's the type of dedicated teacher every principal
should want.
</p>

<p>
So now we have a bunch of stigmatized teachers looking for work in a
system that won't give them a chance. Not only due to them being
considered "damaged goods" but also because they're expensive to
hire. 
</p>

<p>
When a school gets an ATR to them, it's free - the cost isn't added to
their budget - they keep them as extra manpower for the year and then
throw them out with the trash. At times, they get some credit for
keeping them a second year and even beyond they can get rid of them
whenever they want. Great way to bust the contract.
</p>

<p>
A clear example of this is Stuy's  current math chair. He's an ATR
Assistant Principal. They got him for free for the first year and I
believe at a 50% discount for the second and even now they can dump
him whenever they want. This is rubbish – he's either good enough for
the position or he's not. If he is, he should be given the job for
real and if he isn't then what is he still doing there. I'm not making
any value judgment on him or the department but it's either one or the
other.
</p>

<p>
So, a big reason for this ATR mess is about budgets and money. The
problem is that it's a big lie. 
</p>

<p>
The DOE pretends the we have a situation like this:
</p>




<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/atr1.png" alt="atr1.png" align="center" height="250"></p>
</div>

<p>
The DOE has money and schools have money. The schools pay for their
teachers, supplies, and everything else but the ATRS are paid for by
the DOE. Of course this isn't the case. The truth is that the DOE pays
for everything:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/atr2.png" alt="atr2.png" align="center" height="250"></p>
</div>

<p>
ALL the money comes from the DOE.
</p>

<p>
In the past the DOE has come up with poorly conceived and poorly
received plans on how to deal with the ATR situation but it's really
quite simple.
</p>

<p>
Start by recognizing that ALL the money comes from the DOE. Once you
do that you can address the problem:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Assign the ATR to a school</li>
<li>If the school likes the ATR and the ATR likes the school, they keep
them and the DOE picks up the tab or rather adjusts the schools
budget to compensate. The DOE will continue to do so until a real
opening occurs at the school in the ATR's area at which point the
ATR fills the position officially and the budget is readjusted.</li>
<li>If the school or ATR don't like each other the ATR gets rotated,
however you create a 3 strikes (or maybe 2 or 4 or some number)
rule.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the school keeps sending away ATRs semester after semester hit
them with a penalty or force an ATR placement when they have an
opening (assuming the ATR is amenable).</li>
<li>If the ATR keeps declining positions after a set number of
schools force the placement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it. Simple and solves the problem.

This question appeared on Facebook a few days ago:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down
a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my
students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in
subsequent parts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn't
have time then so I thought I'd write it up now.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, it took me forever to find the post again over on
Facebook. If there's a way to mark posts or save a direct link I'd
love to hear it. I had to look through all the CS Ed groups I belong
to manually until I found it again.
</p>

<p>
When I read the program I was reminded of a PD session we had to
attend back at Stuyvesant. Back then the fad was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum">Writing Across the
Curriculum</a>. Every teacher in every class was to give some significant
writing assignment, evaluate it and provide feedback. Let's forget the
fact that most of us never had any training or preparation to do so.
</p>

<p>
On that PD day the guest speaker was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser">William Zinsser</a>. The first thing
he said was that what we were being asked to do by our principal was
bunk. He then proceeded to give advice on  simple good writing.
</p>

<p>
The procedure he recommended following was to ask yourself (or have
the student ask themselves) "what does my audience need to know next?"
That's your next sentence. Then ask the question again. Rinse and
repeat until done.
</p>

<p>
It was simple and it made sense. It also applied to introductory CS
problems. When starting out, students have a limited CS / programming
tool box so a good question for them to ask when trying to solve a
problem is not only "what do I need to do next? but also "what can I
do next?" 
</p>

<p>
When students have a limited CS vocabulary and set of idioms - loops,
conditionals, functions, whatever, there will only be so many things
they can do to move a problem along. If they go through the things the
<b><b>can</b></b> do they will likely fall on to what they <b><b>should</b></b> do.
</p>

<p>
It's similar to doing a proof in geometry. Students have a set of
givens. Given that set, what can they do? They only know so many
theorems at the beginning. 
</p>

<p>
Over time, they'll recognize patterns and develop as problem solvers.
</p>

<p>
If you're part of the AP CS A teachers facebook group you probably saw
the question. Many good answers were posted. I just wanted to add this
thought to the collection.

Last April I woke up early and trekked up to Albany along with a few
of my Hunter College colleagues to share our thoughts on K12 Computer
Science teacher certification with the Board of Regents. We gave a
presentation to the Regents Higher Education Committee and afterwards
had a chance to talk with some of the Regents as well as other members
of the New York State Department of Education.
</p>

<p>
I left feeling that our proposals were well received and I think
everyone present - both the Hunter and NYSED contingents hoped that
things would move forward on this important issue.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to today, December 8, 2017. I was up at the crack
of dawn. Driving in the dark in the snow from NYC to Albany to once
again attend a Board of Regents Higher Education Committee
meeting. This time, the agenda item was:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Proposed Amendments to Part 30 of the Regents Rules and Section 52.21
and Part 80 the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education Relating
to a New Certification Area and Tenure Area for Computer Science 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No discussion or debate this time around just the proposal. If I
understand the process correctly, this should come up again at the
March meeting at which point it will be voted on. If approved, it
looks like we'll have a pathway towards certification for CS teachers.
</p>

<p>
I haven't had a chance to dive into the details but at the meeting a
few key points came up:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As the proposal indicates this will be a subject area in which a
teacher can be certified and be awarded tenure.</li>
<li>There will be a traditional pathway for new teachers - Bachelors /
Masters degree</li>
<li>There will be an alternative pathway for people entering from the
workforce</li>
<li>There will be an extension for teachers with another license so they
won't have to give up tenure in their current license.</li>
<li>There will be an "individual evaluation" pathway which sounds to me
like it could catch people who fall through the cracks.</li>
<li>There looks to be a sensible ramp up period - until September 2022</li>
<li>There's a grandfathering provision that looks to last 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This sounds like a smart sensible plan. Multiple pathways, shallow
ramp up and provisions to protect existing teachers.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the devil is in the details. What's an approved program?
Can a grandfathered teacher teach all CS classes or just intro ones?
etc.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I haven't had a chance to dive into the details yet but
this is very exciting.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the meeting I was chatting with a few other people
attending. One, a <a href="http://www.uft.org/">UFT</a> representative was very excited about the
prospect. Another contingent, a group from <a href="https://www.nysut.org/">NYSUT</a> was very much against
a new certification area. Their position was that this would create a
teacher shortage because no one would have a CS license and no one
would get one due to the difference in salary between teaching and the
tech industry. I've already written on how I feel that this is a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/will-we-lose-cs-teachers-to-industry">red
herring</a>. What shocked me though was their feeling that "we already
have many non-CS teachers effectively teaching CS across the
state. They're doing a great job and don't need any additional content
or pedagogical knowledge." I think they're wrong and I also think that
when we as a community talk about how our summer professional
development is all that's needed, we undercut CS education and
the teaching profession as a whole.
</p>

<p>
In any event this was a big step for New York. I tried to individually
thank as many of the participants as I could for helping shepherd this
along but could only speak to a few so I'll just give a blanket thank
you here to the NY State Board of Regents, Board of Education and
State Education department.

I'm now well behind in <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. Traveling up to Michigan to see
my son and my brother and his family will do that.
</p>

<p>
I was planning on working to catch up but got distracted earlier by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/">this thread</a> on the Advent of Code subreddit. Specifically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">this comment</a>
by <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>, the contest creator. The thread is about the level of
difficulty of the various problems and Eric's comment talks about some
of the factors that go into creating a good collection of problems for
a contest and the difficulties involved.
</p>

<p>
It made me think of a conversation I had twenty years ago with Rob
Kolstad. We were chatting at a programming competition while the
students were hacking away. We were discussing that there were only so
many questions that a typical high school or college competition can
ask:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Mathy question</li>
<li>Recursion / divide and conquer etc.</li>
<li>Graph stuff</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
</ol>
<p>
and I think one or two more. The actual questions were just window
dressing on these fundamental question types. 
</p>

<p>
You can see this in many competitions including Advent of Code -
particularly if you look over all three years. This is not a
criticism. I love Advent of Code and think that Eric and the people
he's working with are doing a great job . Read Eric's comment to get a
deeper dive into what he thinks about as a contest designer.
</p>

<p>
I also got to thinking how similar creating a competition is to
creating an exam. Maybe that's because I'm currently writing the final
my students will take in a couple of days. In class tests are
certainly not the best of assessments but they do have their place and
in any event, they're frequently  required by school or departmental
policy.
</p>

<p>
There are many similarities between what teachers consider when making
tests to what contest designers consider. What concepts and techniques
must the students use? Are the problems too similar? Do they ramp up
in difficulty? Are they all or nothing or can a student incrementally
work their way to a solution? Does one problem lead into another? 
</p>

<p>
There's no big reveal or surprise here today. Just something I've been
thinking about. 
</p>

<p>
A couple of busy days coming up but maybe over the weekend I can get
back to Advent of Code.

I've been having fun with this years <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> competition. So
far, I've been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I'll be traveling for the weekend.
</p>

<p>
After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">subreddit</a>. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there's a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.
</p>

<p>
That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact. 
</p>

<p>
Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it's computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That's true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.

I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:

Yesterday I was one of the judges at <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">StuyHacks</a>. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don't have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.
</p>

<p>
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Java</li>
<li>Processing</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Scratch</li>
<li>A-Frame</li>
<li>Python / Flask</li>
<li>HTML/CSS/JS</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I'm getting old.
</p>

<p>
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I'd love to help with future events.
</p>

<p>
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I've
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
</p>

<p>
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn't seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn't a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we're too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that'll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: "You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata" or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They're prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
</p>

<p>
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
</p>

<p>
A hackathon isn't a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
</p>

<p>
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn't
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers. 
</p>

<p>
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn't
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I'm
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
</p>

<p>
This isn't really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It's just something I noticed. It's a problem for schools and
also for a society that's test obsessed.
</p>

<p>
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you're a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">web page</a> and make sure to attend their next event.

It's once again time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. That one a day programming
competition that's been running now for three years.
</p>

<p>
Here are some thoughts on <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1">day 1</a>. The core of the problem is that you
have a large string of digits and you have to calculate a
checksum. This is done by adding the sum of a subset of the
digits. Only the ones that are identical to the digit to their
right. To make it a little more interesting, the last digit wraps
around to the first for checksum purposes.
</p>

<p>
For example, the input <b><b>2234335</b></b> leads to the calculate <code>2 + 3</code> or
<code>5</code>. The input <b><b>234445662</b></b> leads to <code>4+4+6+2</code> or <code>16</code>. We add 4 for
twice because the first four is adjacent the second and the second the
third. We add the 2 at the end because it wraps around to match the
one at the front.
</p>

<p>
We first read in the data and strip off the trailing newline
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">origdata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">origdata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">origdata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">origdata</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then, since we can access the elements of the string as a list (or
array) it's a simple loop to calculate the sum:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
	<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Don't forget to turn the string into an int</span>

<span class="c1"># data[-1] is the python way of getting the last element - here we check the wraparound</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Checksum: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Pretty straightforward but I don't like the special case of checking
the last element for the wraparound. Sometimes it's possible to get
rid of edge cases like this by <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md">changing the data</a>. We can do that here
by simply appending a copy of the first character to the end of the
list.
</p>

<p>
This leads to a slightly cleaner solution:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
	<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1">#don't forget to turn the string into an int</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Checksum: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This is pretty much what I'd expect from a Python programmer that's
just starting out. We can use a couple of more advanced Python
features to make what I consider a more elegant solution.
</p>

<p>
Python's <b><b>zip</b></b> function takes two lists and interleaves them.
<code>zip("abc","def")</code> will yield <code>[ (a,d), (b,e), (c,f)]</code>. If the lists
are of different length, it just zips up until the shorter list is
exhausted. We can use array slicing to zip the input string with it's
neighbor by using <code>new_list = zip(data,data[1:])</code>. For the string "122344'
zipping gives us <code>[(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,4)]</code>. We can put this in
a list comprehension that only keeps the tuples representing an
element with an identical neighbor and also converts it to an int:
<code>new_list = [int(a) for a,b in new_list if a==b]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we can just calculate the sum. This leads to the following
complete solution:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">checksum</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">([</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">zip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:])</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">checksum</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
List comprehensions for the win!!!!
</p>

<p>
Each Advent of Code problem has two parts. You unlock the second by
solving the first. Here, the wrinkle is that instead of checking each
digit with it's neighbor to the right, you check it with the one
that's halfway around the list. 
</p>

<p>
With loops, the solution is just a quick modification of part 1. We
just add half the length and use mod to find the digit to compare with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"part 2loop version: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>
I wanted to see if I could do this with a list comprehension
though. The trick was to figure out how to make two lists to zip
together to get the pairs to check then add. Here's the solution:
</p>

The insight was that we could just make a second list that starts
halfway through and then wraps around. I did this by adding
<code>data[l//2:] + data</code>. <code>l//2</code> is the integer division of the length (in
Python3). <code>data[l//2:]</code> represents the second half of data (from the
midway point to the end). Technically I should have only added the second
half of data: <code>data[l//2:] + data[:l//2]</code> where <code>data[:l//2]</code> gives us
the first half of the list but since zip will just stop when it
exhausts the shorter list, this wasn't necessary.
</p>

<p>
Day 2 also has a nice list comprehension based solution. Maybe I'll
write that up later.

A week or so ago I wrote about the event we had to kick off 
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-tech-kickoff">Hunter College's partnering with the NY tech community</a> to build a
Hunter to tech pipeline. Each table had two Hunter students and a
group of tech professionals. Each table discussed the Hunter CS
experience and how the tech community can help support the
students. Towards the end of the event a colleague commented that it
was a great idea to have the students essentially run the tables and
how effective it was. I didn't see any other way to do it. 
</p>

<p>
You have to trust the students. Put them in situations where they can
grow.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the event being a success overall, I think that for the
students it helped to break down barriers. These kids are soon to be
joining the tech community. They'll be interviewing for
internships and then jobs and the whole process can be rather
intimidating. By the end of the event the other week, there weren't
tables of students and professionals but rather tables of people all
having discussions on equal footing. It seems like a small thing. A
minor choice on how to run an event but it can have a subtle but
substantial impact in ways that are hard to see unless you look.
</p>

<p>
I was also reminded of this when reading Alfred Thompson's post on 
<a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/11/how-some-schools-sabotage-computer.html">school tech management teams and CS teachers</a>. Alfred wrote about the
possible tension between the needs of CS teachers and the needs of the
rest of the school and the obligations of the people that actually set
up and maintain the technology in a school.
</p>

<p>
Years ago, at Stuy, I skirted the issue by taking on the
obligation of maintaining my own labs. This let me run Linux and
basically do whatever I felt we needed. It also meant my labs wouldn't
be set up for things like standardized testing. This came at a
price. I had to maintain it all myself. This is not to say that the
tech people haven't helped over the years. Some of them have been
terrific but other than swapping out bad machines it all fell on me.
</p>

<p>
Of course this wouldn't have been possible if it really all fell to
me. It only worked because I was able to enlist the aid of students
who wanted to learn about building and running a Linux network. Sure I
showed them some things but largely we <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-31-devops.html">figured it out
together</a>. Basically I trusted the kids with access and control and
gave them a safe place to learn and explore. 
</p>

<p>
It worked amazingly well. 
</p>

<p>
Of course there were plenty of headaches. There was the time when we
only had one AI/X server for the school and Jon somehow erased all the
shared libraries or the time when I think Paul or Ilya took away read
and execute access from all the system executables. I lost plenty of
sleep and pulled out much hair recovering from these messes and others
but I couldn't get too upset. They were learning, no one got hurt, and
truthfully they never committed any blunders worse than my own.
</p>

<p>
Giving up control to the kids can be nerve wracking at times but it's
worth it. It's why I always found coaching more stressful than
competing back when I fenced. You can do everything to prepare your
athletes but when they're out on the strip, there's nothing you can do
to help. It's all on them. On the other hand, I've always been more
gratified with my athletes or students successes than with my
own. There's something special about enabling others.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that we just turn our students loose.  We have to
set our students up to succeed. Set up the environment and the
circumstance and give the students the tools to work with. At the
event two weeks ago I knew that everyone in the room was a friend or
when I have students plan a hackathon and have them cold call a
company, maybe the company expects the call. There are all sorts of
things we can do behind the scenes to set out students up for success.
</p>

<p>
We set the stage and if we do it right, the kids won't
fail to impress.

Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I'm guessing other high
schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten
year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who've
moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
</p>

<p>
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered
crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far
away.
</p>

<p>
I'm always really flattered and honored when I get a reunion
invite. I've been to my share but I was never the hip popular teacher
that gets invited to these things. On the other hand, I'm sincere,
honest, and loyal so when I do connect with students it's meaningful
and lasting. As one of my students remarked when I was nominated to be
graduation speaker a few years ago and I doubted I would be elected
"hey, you lead the most popular cult in the school" and I guess in
some way the community is a cult, or as I'd rather say, a family. In
any event, whenever I'm invited to a reunion I make my best effort to
attend.
</p>

<p>
I find the role of faculty at reunions as somewhat amusing – we're
something of a prop. The grads are there and should be there to
reconnect with each other. The teachers are and should be secondary.
From my point of view, there are three groups of students. The ones
that are now part of my alumni family - now friends who I'm in touch
with to varying degrees, the ones that never knew me and the ones that
knew me a bit. For the second and third groups, as a faculty member,
I'm there to remind them of the glory days as a representative of the
institution.
</p>

<p>
As with all reunions I had plenty of "I was never in your class
but …" conversations. I also a number of "I majored in
fill-in-the-blank but just found my way back into tech
so….. thanks." I love these conversations - it gets someone
new into "the family." I also had one conversation that was really a
nice ego boost. One of my guys introduced me to his wife. She
immediately exclaimed "it's so great to finally meet you, he talks
about you all the time!" That was kind of weird until she went on
"…every time he talks about Stuy." That made more sense. It's like
all those times when me and my buddy Ben would reminisce about our
Junior High school days and we'd always get back to talking about
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html">Herb</a>, one of our best and favorite teachers and a major influence on
me while Devorah looked on confused. Eventually she met and got to
know Herb and it all made sense. Another grad added "you think we all
forget about you but you come up more than you know" so I take that as
a shout out to all of the teachers out there who never get to hear
back about how much they are remembered and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
With tools like email and Facebook it's easier to remain connected to
former students but it's always nice to connect in person. For the
StuyCS family, we have our periodic meetups but for the rest, I love
being included in class reunions and hope to be invited to more in
years to come.
