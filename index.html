Today's video is a bit of a follow up on the last one as well as a few
miscillaneous configuration.
</p>

<p>
We got some comments on alternate ways to load a file if it exists -
it's always cool to see how different people end up doing similar things.
</p>

<p>
We then talk about three little configurations. Two I found out about
reading Jon Sander's (jcs) blog <a href="http://irreal.org/blog">Irreal</a>. Jon's blog is a terrific
source of emacs info - if you don't subscribe, you should.
</p>

<p>
I go over using counsel for working with the kill-ring. The command
counsel-yank-pop acts as a replamcement for yank-pop and it lets you
easily yank anything from the kill ring - not just the most previously
killed/whacked piece. 
</p>

<p>
You just hit <b><b>M-y</b></b> and then either keep hitting it or use up and
down to select what you want to yank. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the original post from Irreal: <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707">http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707</a>.
</p>

<p>
I then briefly talk about smoothing things over between the system
clipboard and the kill ring, also from Irreal:
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5702">http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5702</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I talk about auto-revert-mode - this monitors files on your
file system and when they change, they reload your buffer. I find this
very useful to keep multiple machines in sync when I'm working with
files in a could based filesystem like Dropbox or Owncloud.

Over on Facebook, my Alma Mater and long time employer, Stuyvesant
High School seems to be making a big push to up it's Regeneron Science
Talent Search game. For those of you who aren't familiar, that's the
latest incarnation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneron_Science_Talent_Search">the Westinghouse Science Talent Search</a> from
back in my day.
</p>

<p>
It seems that Stuyvesant hasn't had that many semi finalists,
finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn't happy about
it. The result is a bunch of social media reminding us of old winners
and trying to raise funds to get us back to the glory days.
</p>

<p>
I'd rather they spent there time, energy, and money elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
When I was a young teacher, I was enamored with those types of
results. When my kids did well on a USACO competition, for example, I
felt pretty good about myself.
</p>

<p>
Then one day, I had an epiphany. I was looking over the results of a
big USACO competition. My kids came in 4th, 5th, and I think
fifteenth. I was feeling pretty good about myself but then I realized
that Dan, Evan, and Jon - my three top scorers would probably have
done just fine without me. Sure, I do believe that I was able to help
them in their growth as both computer scientists and as people but
they were already off the charts smart. 
</p>

<p>
The same is true about the Science Talent Search (STS) winners. A
friend of mine ran Stuyvesant's math research class for a number of
years. He had a pretty impressive string of finalists and winners. How
did he do it? 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify Stuyvesant's top talent - the ones already most likely to
succeed in the STS.
</li>
<li>Pawn them off on a lab or professor.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Stuy class, by and large, did little or nothing for these kids yet
we would hold them up as shining examples of how wonderful we were.
</p>

<p>
When I had my epiphany, I started designing my intro class and
focusing my efforts on the whole school population. The results?
Scores of people succeeding in tech who never would have considered it
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
While my super high achievers have indeed gone  on to successful lives
and careers, some of my most successful graduates, by any number of
measures have been the students who would otherwise have gotten lost
in the crowd at Stuy.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, many of Stuyvesant's STS winners would have been STS
winners regardless of where they went. We may or may not have helped
them along the way but STS results are not the measure of a great
school.
</p>

<p>
Improving a school, any school, for all its students might not help in
those bogus national ratings but that really should be what we're
about.

Some of the videos I want to make are going to be much easier to do if
I'm working in my own account where my whole file tree is available. 
</p>

<p>
It's also a little annoying changing between my full emacs config and
the one I'm developing here.
</p>

<p>
So, I decided to move to this config for my real config and as I make
more videos move parts of my old configuration over to this new one.
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that I <b><b>need</b></b> some of my current config right
now – things like my email setup.
</p>

<p>
This video talks about how I'm going to set things up to take care of
everything.

I meant to cover these last time but decided not to so as to keep the
videos to about 10 minutes each.
</p>

<p>
First up this time round is <a href="https://github.com/victorhge/iedit">iedit</a> - a really cool mode that lets you
select all the instances of the marked selection at the same time and
edit them all at once. By default it's bound to <b><b>C-l</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say you had the following code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">somevar</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">somevar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">somevar</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">somevar</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You could mark one instance of <b><b>somevar</b></b>, hit <b><b>C-;</b></b> and you'd be
editing them all at once. When you're done, you hit <b><b>C-;</b></b> again and
everything is un-selected.
</p>

<p>
There are other ways to modify multiple instances of a selection. You
can always search and replace or use Magnar Sveen's really cool
<a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple cursors</a> package and I'm sure there are others but I like
iedit since it's small and simple. It also works for rectangular
editing but I didn't cover that in the video. I'll probably demo it
when I cover rectangular editing in general.
</p>

<p>
Iedit has limitations. For insance, since it works globally, it isn't
perfect for renaming variables. If the above code snippet was part of
a larger program with many other instances of <b><b>somevar</b></b>, iedit
wouldn't, by itself, be as useful.
</p>

<p>
You could reach for a language specific refactoring package but for
me, that's where <b><b>narrowing</b></b> comes in. You can mark a region and
tell emcas to <b><b>narrow-to-region</b></b> which hides everything outside the
region and temporarily (until you <b><b>widen</b></b>) treats the region as the
whole document. 
</p>

<p>
So, you could narrow to the section of code you want to edit and then
use iedit from within.
</p>

<p>
To make things easier, I grabed <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/emacs-narrow-or-widen-dwim.html">narrow-or-winden-dwim</a> from <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless
Parentheses</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think the video makes the behaviour pretty clear.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy

students. The class forms teams that work with a "company champion"
that acts an advisor to build a product.
</p>

<p>
As a Crit Advisor, I, along with two other people from the tech
industry have a give and take with three groups and hopefully we can
provide useful feedback.
</p>

<p>
As a "tech industry person" I feel a bit like an outsider since I'm
really the "teacher guy," but I think I had some worthwhile things to
share with the groups.  Besides,
I'd like to think I'm sufficiently in touch with the tech industry
through "the family" to be a reasonably sound advisor.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, two of the groups I worked with had an education bent
so at least in terms of product they were in my wheelhouse.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to talk specifically about the student products since I
didn't ask permission but I did want to share a few thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The products reminded me very much of the projects my Stuy kids
produced in their senior SoftDev class. This is not to belittle the
Cornell Tech people but rather noting how advanced the work of the
Stuy kids is. Beyond that, I liked the composition of the groups I
talked to - nice combinations of skill sets and backgrounds. 
</p>

<p>
I love the idea of the mentoring company which had an interesting effect on
the groups. In all cases, the mentoring company helped provide the
teams with an idea framework but in one case, I think the company's point of
view actually limited the groups vision a bit. This came up in our
discussions and I'm hoping that the students got something out of
that.
</p>

<p>
I also liked the crit review I was part of - bringing in outsiders to
show your work to and to get feedback from. It would probably hard
logistically at Stuy, but I'll talk to the guys there about the
concept. 
</p>

<p>
I shared my contact info with the two groups that asked and if they
follow up, I'd love to be a resource for them. 
</p>

<p>
I'm also looking forward to taking part in more events like this in
the future.

It's Halloween and for the first time in 21 years, I'm not at work in costume.
</p>

<p>
It all began as a lark in October 1994:
</p>



<div align="center">
<a href="img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" rel="lightbox">
  <img width="30%" src="img/2013-10-31-halloween/groo.jpg" class="" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>
And grew from there. A partial list of characters include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Groo the Wanderer,
</li>
<li>Little Ceaser (Pizza Pizza)
</li>
<li>The Jolly Green Giant
</li>
<li>Homer Simpson (with my seniors as the rest of the cast)
</li>
<li>Duffman
</li>
<li>Hans and Franz (with Boris)
</li>
<li>The Hulk
</li>
<li>The Blues Brothers (with JonAlf)
</li>
<li>Dr. Evil (with JonAlf as Austin Powers)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While it was a lark, I noticed that days after, my students were
somewhat more relaxed and fun. If nothing else, it accelerated us
getting to know each other.
</p>

<p>
A likely turning point was when I was Bob Ross:
</p>


<div align="center">
<a href="img/2013-10-31-halloween/bob_ross.jpg" rel="lightbox">
  <img width="30%" src="img/2013-10-31-halloween/bob_ross.jpg" class="" alt=""></a><a href="img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" rel="lightbox">
  <img width="30%" src="img/2013-10-31-halloween/painting.jpg" class="" alt=""></a>
</div>

<p>
That was the first year that was just as performance based as it was costume based. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, the downside is that pretty soon, I was expected to top
myself every year. The last couple of years were fun but part of me
felt like I was going through the motions. I needed a break.
</p>

<p>
So, now at Hunter College, I'm taking that break - no costume this
year. We'll see what the future holds, but here's a youtube playlist
with some of my favorite halloweens past.

If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to
<a href="http://avc.com">avc.com</a>, Today, <a href="http://avc.com/2016/10/cranes/">Fred's post</a> talked about development and progress,
evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related,
it got me thinking about gentrification. 
</p>

<p>
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out
people and business that were there during the hard times.
</p>

<p>
We don't need to force out long time residents that can no longer make
rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater
economic opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Those of us in CS Education, each in our own way, are trying to help
build those pathways.
</p>

<p>
Return readers know that I've ranted about some of the popular magic
bullets. I've periodically talked about my concerns over code schools
but even at their best they represent a workforce program for the well
to do. I've also talked about efforts like P-Tech which sound good,
but besides the fact that <a href="https://garyrubinstein.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/p-tech-principal-responds/">the emperor has no clothes</a>, is the school
really preparing kids for opportunities in their own neighborhoods or
in data centers far from home?
</p>

<p>
There are some workforce programs like <a href="https://perscholas.org/">Per Scholas</a> that I really like
and respect but they're limited in what they can do.
</p>

<p>
What does that leave us with? The traditional path – college.
</p>

<p>
In terms of tech, New York City has some amazing colleges. You ask
most people, they'll come back with NYU, Columbia. Great institutions
but <b><b>very</b></b> expensive.  Not everyone can afford $75,000 a year and
not everyone can afford to go into hundreds of thousands of debt.
</p>

<p>
This is why Hunter CS is so important. Actually CUNY but I can only
affect my little corner of the world. 
</p>

<p>
Hunter College has a really nice CS program and department. It's small
and has flown under the radar but it's one of the reasons I came over
to Hunter. 
</p>

<p>
One of my responsibilities at Hunter is to develop our new honors CS
program and to connect all of  Hunter CS to the tech sector in NY. 
</p>

<p>
I haven't written much about what's been going on but that will change
int the months to come. Suffice it to say that to uplift our
communities we need real, affordable educational opportunities and in
terms of tech, education that leads to real opportunities in
our city's tech sector.
</p>

<p>
I'm convinced that Hunter College can be a game changer for the wealth
of young talent we have in New York and for our tech sector.

Expand region expands the marked region by semantic units. It's my go

<p>
This past weekend was <a href="http://catskillsconf.com">Catskills Conf</a>, one of my favorite events of the
year.
</p>

<p>
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
</p>

<p>
If you know my wife, you know she's <b><b>always</b></b> knitting. Ok, not true,
she's always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form
of fiber craft.
</p>

<p>
I can't complain. That's how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy
and Kandinsky sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks. It also
keeps her an my entire family in warm amazingly beautiful knit wear.
</p>

<p>
While at the conference, Devorah was her usual self - knitting during
the talks. That doesn't mean she wasn't paying attention, it's just
what she does. We also noted a few other attendees knitting throughout
the weekend.
</p>

<p>
So, this year, Devorah had an idea – let's focus those idle hands to
do some good. She asked the conference organizers to send out an email
to attendees - knit squares during the conference and Devorah will put
them together at the end and we'll donate the blanket we make to
children in need through <a href="https://projectlinus.org/">Project Linus</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The organizers were supportive, if not somewhat skeptical. That was
ok - we also had no idea if this would be a win or a flop.
</p>

<p>
Conference came and Devorah announced the project. She brought yarn,
needles, crochet hooks and instructions and also offered to teach
knitting during the breaks.
</p>

<p>
It started slowly, but as the conference progressed, people started
knitting both during the talks and during the breaks.
</p>

</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>
Experienced knitters cranked out squares and newbies learned.
</p>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/knitting-tech-conference/learning.jpg" alt="learning.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>


<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><p>
At the end of the conference, we collected the partials. Devorah's
going to finish the blanket up this week and then it gets donated.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 X 5 and growing! <a href="https://twitter.com/catskillsconf">@catskillsconf</a> <a href="https://t.co/epC9b3ap0t">pic.twitter.com/epC9b3ap0t</a></p>— Devorah Zamansky (@DevorahZamansky) <a href="https://twitter.com/DevorahZamansky/status/790697247965151232">October 24, 2016</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>
So, how much of a win was this? We got a blanket to donate to charity
and a couple of new knitters. We also heard and overheard some
interesting comments.
</p>

<p>
One speaker commented that it as much better to see members of the
audience knitting for good rather than checking their cell phones.
</p>

<p>
We also overheard some attendees talking about how the knitting
project left them feeling more connected to the conference since they
were able to contribute something.
</p>

<p>
Sounds like a pretty big win to me. 
</p>

<p>
So much so that Devorah's thinking about taking the show on the road -
maybe other conferences would like their idle hands doing some good
while listening to talks.
