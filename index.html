Over in the Facebook AP Computer Science Teachers group someone asked
for thoughts on covering BASH scripting as a post AP topic.
</p>

<p>
A number of us made suggestions. I linked to <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzR7Et9vETt">this</a> old blog post.
</p>

<p>
One group member said she asked around for similar suggestions and the
response she got was "vi and awk." I wanted to jokingly respond "and
after they suggested that they got into their time machine and went
back to the 70's."
</p>

<p>
In all seriousness though, I think that suggesting specific tools or
commands is off base.
</p>

<p>
The important thing to know about Vi is how to get out of it but it
isn't really a tool in the scripting sense. I do think students should
spend a good amount of time learning a powerful editor and should try
bot Emacs (my choice) and Vim but that's another story.
</p>

<p>
I also use AWK but as it's a programming language in it's own right,
I'm not sure if I'd introduce it right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of important ideas kids can take away from learning
some Linux (or other Unix flavor):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's something out there besides Windows and MacOS
</li>
<li>All about free software
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">The Unix Philosophy</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one is the biggie and more specifically, there's a huge
upside in teaching kids the value of "OS as Toolset" where they can
compose the many tools that comprise the Linux experience to get
things done. 
</p>

<p>
I gave an example of that in the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzSBHt9vETu">post</a> I previously linked to.
</p>

<p>
For the teacher, that means wrapping your head around that way of
working. Living in the shell and using pipes to connect program to
progarm to program.
</p>

<p>
I'd recommend getting into a time
machine ourselves and taking a look at: 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment" width="250px" align="center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/English4.gif" alt="English4.gif" width="250px" align="center"></a>

<p>
It's dated but it's really a great book on getting into the Unix way
of doing things, particularly the chapter about filters. It also has
one of the best and clearest introductions to writing a compiler in
the chapter on program development.
</p>

<p>
As I said, it is dated - shells are much easier to use and much more
robust, there are many more tools now, and they've evolved but it's
really a must read book.
</p>

<p>
In terms of tools, I get a lot of mileage out of:

A nice simple thing you can do with these is clean data. Let's say you
want to do some analytics on a book from Project Gutenberg. You might
want to convert all non letters to spaces, and all letters to lower
case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat book.txt | sed "s/[^a-zA-Z ]/ /g | tr A-Z a-z"
</pre></div>

<p>
That sends book.txt into sed which uses a regular expression to convert
no space and letters to spaces. The tr command converts all upper case
letters to lower case.
</p>

<p>
If you want one word per line, add:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "s/\n/g"
</pre></div>

<p>
and maybe get rid of blank lines:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "/^$/d"
</pre></div>

<p>
We can now count the number of words in the file using <b><b>*wc</b></b> or even
get counts of all the words:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</pre></div>

<p>
<b><b>sort</b></b> will sort all the lines, <b><b>uniq -c</b></b> will compress the lines that are
adjacent and the same and give you a count and then <b><b>sort -n</b></b> will
sort the results numerically.
</p>

<p>
I wrote another post a while ago about using the shell to detect
who responded on a Google form. It looks like it didn't convert when
I moved to my current blogging platform - I'll repost that shortly.

Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/dougpete">Doug Peterson</a> wrote a "Whatever happened to" post subtitled
<a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/whatever-happened-to-5/">HTML as an essential 21st Century skill?</a> It's a nice post.
</p>

<p>
I left a comment but thought I'd elaborate here.
</p>

<p>
No, knowing HTML is not programming - it's markup. Even so, when I
help people design CS programs, I'll frequently recommend starting
with HTML or at least introducing it early.
</p>

<p>
Why? 
</p>

<p>
It's a gateway and not just to programming.
</p>

<p>
HTML is pretty easy, you want <b><b>something</b></b> bold, you just wrap the
word in <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;b&gt;something&lt;/b&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
It's also empowering and demystifies the web. Kids can create a simple
web page and load it right into their browser.
</p>

<p>
It's true that today's web pages are chock-full-o javascript and css
but with just the basics, students can get the idea. You can also show
them pages by right clicking and viewing source.
</p>

<p>
You can even have them change a live page.
</p>

<p>
Try it. 
</p>

<p>
Right click on the top of this page where it says "Musings about…"
Chose <b><b>inspect element</b></b>. In the "debugger" window double click the
text, change it and hit enter. This is just temporary - just reload
the page but it's pretty neat for a kid to change an article and then
screenshot it.
</p>

<p>
HTML is also a nice stepping stone towards coding. You're working in a
plain text editor by adding special code words to basic text which are
then interpreted by, in this case, the web browser.
</p>

<p>
The big reason for teaching html actually goes beyond this. Next step
after learning HTML is having the kids programatically generating web
pages in whatever language you're using for the class. I like using
Python. This requires a little infrastructure setup to serve kids work
but then there are two huge wins.
</p>

<p>
First, as the kids learn programming, instead of just printing out
results, they can make a web site with their results and share it with
friends, family, and the world.
</p>

<p>
The other big bonus is that kids might be able to leverage take these
skills to other classes. If the student has a history paper to write,
maybe the teacher will accept a history web site where the student can
write code to do their analytics and build nice looking tables and
graphs with results.
</p>

<p>
So while knowledge of HTML in and of itself isn't really needed
anymore it's still an important part of the programs I build.

Some good points in the Facebook comments on my <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.Vy5aAd9vH0o">last post</a>. One notable
comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn't be able to gain the
traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true
but also sad that we've awarded such educational authority to a
private company that's accountable to no one. Schools should run
courses because they're good for kids not specifically because they're
AP.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant just implemented a policy that every student has to take at
least one AP class to graduate and that now every student in an AP
class has to take the AP exam. There's also been a push for Stuy to
run APCS Principles in spite of the fact that the current home grown
intro course is superior.  
</p>

<p>
These policies and pushes at Stuy are purely for the sake of ratings
and in no way for the benefit of the student.
</p>

<p>
But let's imagine a world without the college board.  To do this we're
going to have to take off our computer science hats and look at
another, more established high school subject area - mathematics.
</p>

<p>
First, setting the stage.
</p>

<p>
It's the mid 1990's. High school students across the nation are taking
math classes. Some are even taking calculus. This makes the College
Board happy since they offer two AP Calculus exams. But the College
Board notices that many students aren't ready for calculus. To fill
this gap, they create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Statistics">AP Statistics</a>. First offered in 1997 to 7,667
students it was given to almost 200,000 students last year.
</p>

<p>
According to wikipedia, the course was created to give an AP
mathematics option for students not ready for calculus. 
</p>

<p>
I don't seem to recall any huge demand for an AP statistics course but
it was created and adopted. It turned into one of the fastest growing
AP classes and a nice money maker for the college board. I don't know
how the class was pushed or perceived in other schools but at Stuy it
was seen as a way to get an easy AP math course on the
transcript. Before any statisticians get the torches and pitchforks -
I'm just relaying the student perception. I haven't looked into the
course sufficiently to form an opinion on it.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's imagine a world without the College Board.
</p>

<p>
An individual school would look at it's students needs and decide if
they needed an additional math course. Maybe they'd conclude that what they
were doing was fine or maybe they would conclude that a new class was
needed. 
</p>

<p>
If they decided they needed a new advanced course the school would
either have the expertise to create it in house or they'd probably
turn to the local college or university for guidance.
</p>

<p>
They might end up with a course very similar to AP Statistics or they
might end up with something very different. They might
end up with another class like Discrete Math or they might end up
partnering with the college and having students take classes there. In
all cases, since math teachers generally have a pretty good math
backgroud, schools could make good decisions and design sound
educational experiences for their kids.
</p>

<p>
All of these seem to be better results for the students than blindly
following the College Board - keeping
education and education decisions local.
</p>

<p>
What about CS?
</p>

<p>
I admit that's a tougher nut to crack.
</p>

<p>
Most schools generally don't currently have the in house expertise
needed to build their own solutions or even to really critically judge
what's out there. 
</p>

<p>
That said, even if you need join the cult of the College Board to get
your school to run some CS you can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grab all the materials you can find - those labeled AP and those not
labeled AP.
</li>
<li>Don't bother with AP Syllabus certification. Teach what you think is
best. Designate the class as honors to differentiate them from other
classes.
</li>
<li>Engage with your local college and tech sector. They're not high
school educators but they are valuable resources.
</li>
<li>Unrelated side note - be wary of code schools - most don't really
have any educational chops.
</li>
<li>Don't force kids to sit for the exams and only encourage them to do
so if the exam will likely do something for the kid.  
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think that's it or my College Board rants.
</p>

<p>
Then again, I also thought that when I wrote Friday's post.

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/college-board/">Yesterday</a>, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook
hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
</p>

<p>
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don't trust our
high school teachers. 
</p>

<p>
I usually use phrases like "society doesn't trust" but let's
personalize it this time – for parents, think about whether or not you trust your
kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization
more?
</p>

<p>
If you teach an advanced placement course, in order for your class to
be listed as AP you have to submit your syllabus to the college board
for approval. This sounds like they're setting a standard but it's
not. I can point to a bunch of teachers who have submitted identical syllabi
where sometimes it's accepted but ofttimes it's rejected. This is the
syllabus we submitted originally for Stuy. Yes, we have high achieving
kids, but given the fact that the syllabus was approved originally and
that Stuy students just about all score 4 or 5 on APCS-A should tell
you something about the level of care or competence of the College
Board.
</p>

<p>
Then you teach the class and in May, one to two months before the end
of the semester the kids take the AP exam - you don't see results
until the summer.
</p>

<p>
In theory, if the kids do well they can receive placement or
credit. The problem is, fewer and fewer schools are giving credit,
when they do, it might not help due to the way undergrads pay for
courses and placement can generally be achieved by appealing to
college departments or by taking college administered placements.
</p>

<p>
Back to the trust thing.
</p>

<p>
In college, you take a course, the final exam is created by the
professor or a group of professors and it's graded by the people that
teach the course - possibly as a committee. Kids final grades include
these exams but a student can fail a final or even miss one and still
pass the class whereas an AP exam is a one shot deal and even if you
"pass" you might not get anything from it. I'm not even getting into
questioning the quality and content of the exams. 
</p>

<p>
Kids get their grades and college credit. There are no outside
"standardized exams" and we trust that the professors and the colleges
are educating our kids. 
</p>

<p>
Now, in high school, teachers make their lessons, teach their classes,
create, administer, and grade final exams and kids get grade - but not
for college level classes.
</p>

<p>
I know multiple high school physics, chemistry, math, and computer
science teachers who are far better at teaching than their college
counterparts yet my friend the math teacher isn't trusted to assess
his calculus students for the purpose of college credit - we don't
trust him but we trust the faceless entity known as the College
Board. 
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
Think about that for a minute.
</p>

<p>
You trust your child's teacher with your child's well being every
day but you don't trust him to say whether or not your kid knows
calculus?
</p>

<p>
This is a real problem.
</p>

<p>
I have a friend who frequently doesn't quite finish the BC Calculus
test topics because he actually teaches the material in depth –
instead of "follow the scripts" the kids go through proofs and
derivations. It costs the kids - I know a number of them who got a 4
on the BC exam rather than a 5 but come the end of June when the class
is done, they know more calculus more deeply than a lot of kids who've
taken the class in college. 
</p>

<p>
The lines of college have been blurred with more and more "remedial"
classes being taught at the college level and more and more "college
level" being taught in the high schools.
</p>

<p>
It's a really sad state of affairs when we trust our professors - many
of whom are hired more for research than for their teaching chops
and we don't trust our teachers during our kids more formative years.

    <p>
It's important to remember, the college board is about making money
for the college board. It's not about supporting teachers and it's
certainly  not about educating kids.
</p>


<p>
Kids took the AP Computer Science A exam last week and the College
Board just released the free response questions. There seems to me
more chatter about them in social media than in past years.
</p>

<p>
I'm just left wondering how AP became the be all and end all.
</p>

<p>
From where I stand, the College Board, who runs AP, SAT, and PSAT
exams is all about making money for the College Board - they're a
non-profit in name only.
</p>

<p>
It's all about market share and dominance.
</p>

<p>
Looking at APCS A, it's not a great exam or course. At Stuy, I taught
a super-set of the old AB and pretty much ignored the parts I didn't
like (that is, the case study) but many schools can't do that. In my
case, most of the schools my kids went to didn't award credit, even
for a 5. They did sometimes award placement but I've had just as many,
if not more kids gain placement just by showing their work to the CS
department at their chosen school.
</p>

<p>
Now they're rolling out APCS Principles. I do get the fact that many
schools don't have people to roll their own courses, but I'm not
overly impressed by much of what's come out. I think what we've
developed is stronger and time proven.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, and moving beyond just CS, the College Board has somehow
bamboozled the public to think AP = Good. Colleges are awarding less
and less credit but everyone's telling the kids to take more and more
AP classes. What's worse, somehow US News and World Report magically
became an authority on school ratings and now the more AP classes your
kids take the better.
</p>

<p>
I know of at least one school with a highly lauded principal boast
about all his kids came in behind in math and by their senior year
passed honors calculus. Looking at the data unfortunately showed that
while all his seniors took the class, all failed, scoring below
a 3. It made the school look great but I'd argue that it was child
abuse.
</p>

<p>
The principal of course parlayed that gig to an even higher profile
one.
</p>

<p>
Now, you could just file the stupid paperwork so that you can run
classes labeled as AP and have kids take the classes but not the exam
but the College Board's working on that - there are rumblings in NY
on using <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2016/04/13/new-york-considering-using-scores-on-ap-exams-and-sat-subject-tests-in-teacher-evaluations/#.VyyRlN9vGAk">student AP scores in teacher ratings</a>. Using student test
results for teacher ratings is already a bad idea - using AP is even
worse.
</p>

<p>
Of course, to really get the cash cow going, AP is entering deals with
agencies and municipalities for large scale testing – in NY students will have to take the
SAT and <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/nyc-will-give-free-sat-testing-to-hs-juniors.html">take it for free</a>. Then there's code.org's deal free PD for
school's that have their kids take <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/">yet another meaningless exam</a>, the
new PSAT/8-9.
</p>

<p>
Of course, none of this is free - it's our taxpayer money hard at work
being shuttled right into the college board.
</p>

<p>
What are we getting? Tests that they create and control and are
EXTREMELY secretive about that don't tell us anyhting that we don't
already know about our kids. Oh, and teachers lose instructional time
and have to <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-13-psat.html/#.VyzHNN9vGAk">proctor</a> these exams instead of teaching.
</p>

<p>
Great deal if you can get it.
</p>

<p>
Now, what's the value of this – more meaningless tests for the
kids. I don't know if there's a record of this anywhere but in the
pre-internet day, I remember watching a news report where a College
Board representative stated that the SAT was a valid predictor of one
thing - how students would do on future SAT exams.
</p>

<p>
So, were left with more money flowing to an outside company with
students taking more meaningless tests.
</p>

<p>
I wish more schools showed the backbone that Fieldston, an elite
private school in NY had when it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/nyregion/high-school-drops-its-ap-courses-and-colleges-don-t-seem-to-mind.html">dropped A.P. courses</a> over 10 years
ago. They still seem to be well regarded as a school and their kids do
just fine in terms of college acceptance.

Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the
comments, this post isn't  about what's appropriate for HS CS. It's
more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it
high school, college, code school, or other. 
</p>

<p>
Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations
of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.
</p>

<p>
The two examples are just to illustrate the point.

I enjoy reading blogs. It's one of the ways I keep current. Not only
in terms of what's going on in CS Education, but also trends in CS -
academic or professional as well as on a range of other topics.
</p>

<p>
One of the blogs I enjoy is authored by <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a>. I don't know
Julia, but we do have some mutual friends. I've enjoyed her <a href="http://jvns.ca">blog</a>. She
does a nice job talking about any number of systems related
issue. I've tried to leave comments a few times but for some reason,
my comments always end up deleted or otherwise not showing up.
</p>

<p>
One recent post, one on <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/29/thread-pools-part-ii-i-love-blocking/">concurrency</a> got me thinking. Since the comment
I left there didn't take, I thought I'd write about it here.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice post but the thing that caught my eye was when Julia
said that she " didn't know what a semaphore was until I read this
code and I was like OH THIS IS AMAZING AND SO USEFUL AND WOW." I was a
little surprised, semaphores seem to be one of those basic concepts
that you just know but that is, of course incorrect. I first learned
about semaphores in my honors Systems class with my mentor, the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dewar">Robert Dewar</a>. We started from test and set and worked our way up. I
had two other undergraduate classes that at least mentioned the topic.
</p>

<p>
Then again, I knew that many undergrads would never get a good
treatment of concurrency so I tried to build a bit in to the System
Level Programming  course I designed while at Stuy.
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking - according to her linked in, Julia was a CS
major at McGill - a university that I hold in high regard but either
semaphores were never covered or their treatment didn't make enough of
an impact to be worth remembering. What topics do we cover in our
classes that kids just let fall to the wayside and what topics do we
end up losing as curricula change and we don't have an eye on the big
picture.
</p>

<p>
One big one is memory management. When APCS and college 101 classes
went to Java, memory management went out the window. Not a problem, as
long as memory issues are covered in some other course. Unfortunately
the don't seem to be. You can make a case that kids don't need to
understand memory management or anything about garbage collection but
I'd argue that while one might never have to do their own memory
management a good CS person should have some understanding of what's
going on under the hood or as my friend Gerry says "never use a
technology you couldn't write yourself."
</p>

<p>
Another biggie that I lived through was the IBM PC era. Prior to the
mid to late 80's when the IBM PC ruled the world, kids learned about
CS on timesharing systems. Once the PC took hold, every kid learning
programming or studying CS was working on their own machine. They had
full access to everything and the machine just supported a single
thread. 
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it was nice since you could easily play with low
level programming and hardware but on the other hand, a hole
generation didn't learn about the complexities of multiple users and
multiple processes. 
</p>

<p>
Early in my career I designed courses and only later did I realize
that you can't just design a course, you have to look at the full arc
of a students education. 
</p>

<p>
I think it's interesting to think about what concepts are getting left
on the side of the road and I wonder if the big players driving CS
education spend any time thinking about this bigger picture.

The difficulties I've had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
</p>

<p>
Today I'm going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students. 
</p>


<p>
CSTUY's not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
</p>

<p>
That's not something I'm happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn't have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven't had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
</p>

<p>
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we've had with
fundraising as compared to the "chosen programs" in 
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o">this post</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've also written a bit about related issues in these posts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

</li>
</ul>
<p>
In any event, we weren't going to be able to run this summer.
</p>

<p>
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, "if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?" I told him, I'd love to.
</p>

<p>
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we'd run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn't have to worry about equipment. 
</p>

<p>
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn't needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
</p>

<p>
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we'd be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I'd help with
initial organization but I wouldn't actually work the summer.
</p>

<p>
So, to summarize:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free for the kids
</li>
<li>I'm not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
important for later)
</li>
<li>My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
would supply the funds to pay them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant's principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn't be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
</p>

<p>
You see, it's very important that teachers and former teachers don't
actually benefit from working extra – it's critical that teachers be
kept down.
</p>

<p>
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren't
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can't talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a <b><b>free</b></b>
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this <b><b>huge</b></b> benefit. Sure they'd be paid for
their time, but that seems fair. 
</p>

<p>
As to me, I'm not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking <b><b>no</b></b> pay so that
the kids wouldn't be left without a program. Nope, that's no good -
can't have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
</p>

<p>
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn't really surprised.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn't work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn't negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't like a certain NYC School's Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn't a conflict - I
guess it's just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren't meant for the higher ups.
</p>

<p>
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn't work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was "because of the union?"
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done <b><b>far</b></b> more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
</p>

<p>
Back to the story.
</p>

<p>
So, we're not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I'm sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I'd take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
</p>

<p>
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren't affected, it's the kids that lose out.

There are all sorts of awards for teachers. The Presidential awards,
NEA awards, National and State level awards, and more. There are also
awards and honors given in more narrow areas like NCTM for math and
our own ACM.
</p>

<p>
I've haven't won any and never expected to. I've never played well
with the establishment.
</p>

<p>
It's ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say "there's
a master teacher," there are half a dozen who you look at just know
that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching
chops.
</p>

<p>
Like anyone else, though, I do like a pat on the back and it is nice
to get some confirmation that you're having a positive effect on kids
lives.
</p>

<p>
So what are my awards? Well, I received what I consider my highest
honor this past weekend. I was in Hot Springs Arkansas for Jen and
Marcel's wedding. 
</p>

<p>
It was a great weekend with old friends and new celerbrating a
wonderful event and I couldn't be happier for the couple.
</p>

<p>
As a teacher, to be included in your former students life events is as
big as it gets. I can't begin to say how honored I was to be included
in their day. Even more special, that Marcel's brother Barnabas and
his wife Suki are my oldest couple - they started dating back in my
class back in the beginning.
</p>

<p>
It's not the first time I've been invited to former students
weddings. I've seen around a dozen or so of my students wed. Every
time it's special, just as it's special when a former student decides
to reach out to let me know how they're doing or to reconnect in
general. When they elect to share part of their lives with me, it
tells me that I was at least a little bit of a force for good way back
when.

A few weeks ago, a friend asked if I knew any CS teachers that were
available to work this summer. At the time, I didn't have anyone to
recommend. We were still up in the air on running CSTUY's SHIP summer
immersion program.
</p>

<p>
We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the
fact that in my new position, I didn't have the time to do the
necessary fund-raising and outreach. We're continuing with our Saturday
program through mid May and plan to bring more opportunities to the
kids of New York City in the future.
</p>

<p>
That's not what I want to write about today. That summer program
looking for a teacher, let's call it program X made me think about
many of the players driving K12 CS education both in NY and beyond.
</p>

<p>
It turns out, the people that were running program X didn't have a
teacher, didn't have curriculum or program, and in fact didn't have
a plan. What they were able to do, however, was raise money.
</p>

<p>
This is a sore spot with me - for CSTUY, we run program to program and
for me, fund-raising is the hardest part. Here we have a program that
has no idea as to what they're going to do or who's going to do it and
they ended up with substantial capital to work this non-existent
program.
</p>

<p>
It's a sore spot because I've seen it before and seen it over and
over. People with either little or no CS experience, little or no
teaching experience and frequently neither being anointed as thought
leaders in CS Education or at the very least, the people with the "hot
program."
</p>

<p>
I've seen this in companies, non-profits, for-profits, and
government. Some of these groups and programs are now considered
undisputed leaders when, if you dig beneath the hype, they really
don't know what they're doing.
</p>

<p>
Now, there are some "thought leaders" who have been in the trenches
and know their stuff but they seem few and far between. 
</p>

<p>
I know that all of these people running these programs and being given
this platform to influence our young are well meaning and I welcome
everybody to the table but maybe, just maybe they should take a step
back and ask themselves - do they really know what they're doing or
are the just experimenting with other peoples children.

Switched over from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> yesterday.
</p>

<p>
One of the primary reasons was that I got fed up with managing a Ruby
development environment across all my machines. In spite of my
rantings, I'm sure Ruby and Ruby installs are fine - it's just
something that I'd have to deal with on a recurring basis for one
specific task - other than for Jekyll blogging, I don't use Ruby.
</p>

<p>
So while a platform based on Python - generally my go to language,
made sense, the other driving force for the switch was the fact that
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> have become such major parts of my workflow and
productivity.
</p>

<p>
What do I use org-mode for?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lesson planning
</li>
<li>document preparation (instead of LaTeX)
</li>
<li>note taking
</li>
<li>blogging
</li>
<li>email (with mu4e)
</li>
<li>managing my schedule
</li>
<li>tracking bookmarks
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and probably a lot more.
</p>

<p>
Jekyll is actually a really nice tool. It's simple. You put together a
simple directory structure: Templates in _layouts, blog posts in
_posts, drafts in _drafts. Other directories that start with an
underscore are ignored and everything else is copied up to your site.
</p>

<p>
I love that it's "close to the metal" You can put in html files with
some meta information up top or markdown. 
</p>

<p>
You can take a look at my old site at
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll"></a><a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll</a> if you want to
take a look.
</p>

<p>
The beauty is that you just push your files up to GitHub and it
automatically runs Jekyll and builds your site (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">more info here</a>).
</p>

<p>
The problem is that Jekyll doesn't play well with org-mode and
org-markup so my workflow became something like this
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a post <b><b>something.org</b></b> in the _org directory.
</li>
<li>From within emacs, publish it. I've configured org-mode to publish
by exporting the org-mode markup file to html and saving it in the
_drafts directory.
</li>
<li>If it looks good, copy and rename the file from _drafts to the
_posts directory and push it up to GitHub.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A little clunky, but it works. The bigger problem was the amount of
time I'd spend putting html blocks into my org formatted posts to get
them to look the way I wanted (or at least close enough).
</p>

<p>
Enter Nikola.
</p>

<p>
Nikola's a much more powerful tool. It does much more but as a result
is much more complex. Normally, that's not my style but in this case
since It's Python, things balance out.
</p>

<p>
I still have to figure out the entire templating system and all the
plugins but getting started was pretty quick.
</p>

<p>
The big win is that Nikola supports a ton of formats for your posts
and pages. Native org-mode support for me was what did it for me. On top of
that, although I haven't tested it yet, is that there's also an
org-mode plugin to export to Nikola restructure text.
</p>

<p>
My new workflow:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write the post as an org-mode file.
</li>
<li>run <b><b>nikola github_deploy</b></b>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that's it. You can look at my Nikola site here:
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io"></a><a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io</a>.
The source code is in the <b><b>src</b></b> branch, the actual rendered blog in
the <b><b>master</b></b> branch.
</p>

<p>
So far, I'm pretty happy with the setup.
