    <p>
Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of <a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/navajo/">Navajo Math Circles</a>, a
documentary on a <a href="http://www.mathcircles.org/">Math Circle</a> put in place to support and enrich the
currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.
</p>

<p>
At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment
programs. I'm most familiar with the <a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/">New York Math Circle</a>. I'm friends
with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in
their summer program for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
Over in the southwest, these Math Circles have been bringing together
students, frequently across great distances each day to explore
problem solving and creativity through mathematics.
</p>

<p>
As someone who's worked hard to bring educational opportunities to the
have nots, I love the program. Some of the highlights include the kids
working on open ended problems, focusing on process and techniques
more than specific results, working both collaboratively but also
developing self sufficiency, and more. I also love the fact that
they've started teacher math circles to help to bring some of that
math circle magic to the everyday classroom.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the film and recommend you check it out to see what's
possible and I want to share my two big takeaways.
</p>

<p>
First, early on in the film, one of the people running the program
talked about developing a math enrichment program through and with
Navajo traditions and culture. This is HUGE and I feel it's something
we're losing. America is so diverse from coast to coast and here in
New York City you can see radically different ways of life living
right across the street from each other. Everyone pays lip service to
"making the work interesting and relevant to the student" but few
people walk the walk. These folk do.
</p>

<p>
Second, I left the documentary with a sour taste in my mouth. Not
because of the program but because the Navajo Math Circle project and
projects like it are scraping together what little resources they can
to try to do what the school systems should be doing to begin with.
</p>


<p>
As we move to scripted lessons, national standards, curricula dictated
or at least influenced by large private concerns and standardized
tests, our schools are moving further and further away from community
and local culture.
</p>

<p>
In the documentary, one student pointed out that in math class, they
have to use the textbook. They learn the process and then have to
solve the problems. In Math Circle, there are no textbooks. 
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, the students in from the Math Circle did some Q&amp;A. I asked
them to elaborate - what's the difference between there Math Circle
experiences and their in school ones. I got:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Math Circle is fun!!!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think that says it all.
</p>

<p>
I know many great teachers who try to bring culture and community to
their classes. One of my son's best teachers, <a href="http://www.heinemann.com/authors/828.aspx">Paula Rogovin</a> did it all
the time. Many of my friends and colleagues try to do so as well but
the powers that be make it harder and harder. 
</p>

<p>
Until we win back public education it's important to support programs
like Math Circles (and, if I do say so myself, programs like our own
<a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY</a>) and it's also critical that we work to try to bring community
and culture to our regular classes.

<p>
Now that we're past the intro material, we'll start looking at emacs
features one at a time. This will let you focus on using the one
feature we're covering, fit it into your work flow, and really get
comfortable with it. 
</p>

<p>
This time we'll dive into using Emacs effectively with buffers.
</p>

<p>
Watch the video and then make a real effort to use buffers over the
next few emacs sessions. Before you know it, they'll be a natural part
of your work flow.
</p>

<p>
The idea of incrementally learning a tool this way seems to be called
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/">developing micro-habits</a> and I first read about the idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/sachac">Sacha
Chua</a> who is an amazing member of the emacs community.
</p>

<p>
When seeing beginners, I'll frequently observe this work flow:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open a terminal
</li>
<li>Load emacs on a file
</li>
<li>Edit the file
</li>
<li>Save and quit emacs
</li>
<li>Try to compile and run the program (since usually this is in a programming class)
</li>
<li>repeat
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the beginner needs to see multiple files at once, they fire up multiple separate emacs.
</p>

<p>
All of this causes me physical pain.
</p>

<p>
In emacs, your editor can load several buffers at once, each
associated with a separate file. You can quickly switch between them,
search across them, and more. The video will get you started.
</p>

<p>
The video also mentions <b>ido</b> mode. To set up <b>ido</b> mode, add the
following code to your init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-enable-flex-matching</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">ido-everywhere</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">ido-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
And here's a great little write up on it by <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide">Mickey Petersen</a>:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode">https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode</a>
</p>


<p>
As I mentioned in the video, I actually use another mode for completions (<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">swiper</a>),
which I'll cover in a future video and another popular option is <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a>
which we'll also cover.
</p>

<p>
For buffers, the keys to remember are:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="left">
<col class="left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">Key</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Command</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x b</td>
<td class="left">switch-buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="left">C-x C-b</td>
<td class="left">list-buffers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
To use ibuffer, which is more powerful than list-buffers you can add
either:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Or if you want to open ibuffer in another Window:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defalias</span> <span class="ss">'list-buffers</span> <span class="ss">'ibuffer-other-window</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; make ibuffer default</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Here are a couple of useful links on ibuffer and buffer switching:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_buffer_switching.html">http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_buffer_switching.html</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://mytechrants.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/emacs-tip-of-the-day-start-using-ibuffer-asap/">https://mytechrants.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/emacs-tip-of-the-day-start-using-ibuffer-asap/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, if you like a tab bar, you can add the following to your
init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">tabbar</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tabbar-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
There's also a package <a href="https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el">tabbar-ruler</a> which is supposed to make the
tabbar look nicer but since I don't use the tabbar at all, I haven't
checked it out.
</p>

<p>
Hope this gets you using emacs more effectively.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for our next video on window management.

<p>
Many people think of Emacs as an editor. I like to think of it as an Elisp interpreter where you live code documents.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, it's like those new fangled interactive programming environments where you type in code and the updates are reflected instantly. 
</p>

<p>
In this video, I try to explain the way I think about Emacs and why it's so cool.
</p>

<p>
The only change we made to our configuration was adding:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tool-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Which gets rid of the tool bar at the top.
</p>

<p>
Next time, we start talking about efficiently using Emacs.

<p>
This video is a brief introduction to org-mode, a mode I use for all
sorts of things.
</p>

<p>
We'll dive into org-mode later in the series. Right now I just want
you to see the basics since we'll be using org-mode for any notes that
are written up during this series. 
</p>

<p>
Actually, all my blog posts are written in org-mode.
</p>

<p>
Here are the important lines to add to your Emacs <b>init.el</b> file  to
get the nice looking bullets when in org-mode:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">org-bullets</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-bullets-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
About a month ago, Emacs user Harry Schwartz gave a nice overview talk
on org-mode. If you want to get a better idea as to all the things you
can do with it, check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4</a>
</p>

<p>
Next time, we'll look at a little Elisp. After that, we'll dive in to
using Emacs effectively and efficiently.

<p>
We configured emacs by creating a folder named <b>.emacs.d</b> and creating a
file within it named <b>init.el</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the contents of that file:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">inhibit-startup-message</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">which-key-mode</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The last two <b>inituse-package</b> clauses install two helpful packages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<b>try</b>: let's you try packages without installing them.
</li>
<li>
<b>which-key</b>: brings up help on key combinations.

I'm sure I've mentioned that I've been an Emacs wonk for
decades. Since the mid-80's in fact. I've spent time using other
editors, word processors, and development tools but always find my way
back.
</p>

<p>
I recommend that budding computer science students develop a good tool
set and encourage them to explore Emacs but while it's pretty easy to
load Emacs and find your way around, particularly if you use the mouse
and menus there isn't a clear path to take you from beginner to using
it as an efficient tool let alone customizing it.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/featured">Mattias Petter Johansson</a>, or MPJ who make a weekly video,
I decided to try to create a series of YouTube videos and matching
blog posts. I'll try to post one a week and I'll try to keep the
videos, at least after the first couple to just a few minutes and have
them focus on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/">micro-habits</a> - one or two small things that you can
bring to your work flow and internalize.
</p>

<p>
The first three four (this one and the next three) will focus on
setting things up. After this post we'll have
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setting up the package manager
</li>
<li>Intro to org-mode (just so that you recognize the markup)
</li>
<li>Intro to Elisp (just so you have an idea of those configuration
lines)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and then we're off to the races. Here's what I'm thinking about for
the first few topics after the above mentioned ones:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Efficient Navigation
</li>
<li>Windows and Buffers
</li>
<li>Theming
</li>
<li>Auto Completion
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and then a series of short topics to show some of my favorite editing
tools. We'll also cover some larger topics including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python Development
</li>
<li>C/C++ Development
</li>
<li>Document Preparation
</li>
<li>Scheduling / Calendaring / Note Taking
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll put together an index to these posts along with any ancillary
materials here: <a href="file:///stories/emacs"></a><a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs">http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs</a>.

I haven't been teaching this past semester. That's why I haven't been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
</p>

<p>
It's also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
</p>

<p>
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating. 
</p>

<p>
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader">Ria</a> recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it's locked in the Facebook silo. I've got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let's focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
</p>

<p>
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred</a> wrote a bit about it on his blog <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html">here</a> where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
</p>

<p>
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
</p>

<p>
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle
</li>
<li>Dropbox based solutions
</li>
<li>Emailing projects
</li>
<li>Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
or other repository hosting services
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
</p>

<p>
Interesting enough, I've gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos. 
</p>

<p>
I keep hearing "the kids will copy from each other" or something like
that. 
</p>

<p>
As Alfred said in his post: "Students have been copying from
classmates for years."
</p>

<p>
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we've
been teaching CS and they'll be doing it for years to come. 
</p>

<p>
Using a hidden submission system doesn't help and could hurt.
</p>

<p>
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
</p>

<p>
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
</p>

<p>
It's a win all around.
</p>

<p>
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness. 
</p>

<p>
So what do I do on the cheating front?
</p>

<p>
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest. 
</p>

<p>
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I'll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
</p>

<p>
GitHub also gives tools that help. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the GitHub graph for a project:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/github-graph.png" alt="github-graph.png" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
</p>

<p>
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
</p>

<p>
Technology isn't going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don't stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
</p>

<p>
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.

Quick post to add to the recent command line fu I've been writing
about.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/dougpete">Douglas Peterson</a> had another <b><b>Whatever happened to</b></b> post. This time
on <a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/whatever-happened-to-6/">Logo</a>. I wanted to reply, talk about NetLogo  and link to some of my
old NetLogo posts to help show how cool it is.
</p>

<p>
Nikola supports tags, makes a nice <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories">tags</a> page and for each tag, a nice
page of all the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/netlogo">links</a>. 
</p>


<p>
Nikola has a plugin <b><b>tags</b></b> which lets you manage tags from the
command line. For instance:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola tags -a netlogo posts/somepost.org
</pre></div>

<p>
Would add the tag <b><b>netlogo</b></b> to the specified post.
</p>

<p>
The problem: The tags plugin only works if the post has a <b><b>tag:</b></b>
line already present in it's header comment and I hadn't put them in
my older posts.
</p>

<p>
I had a bunch of posts, all of them in one directory. All the new ones
were <b><b>.org</b></b> files and had the tag slug. The others were <b><b>.md</b></b> markdown
files and <b><b>.html</b></b> html files. 
</p>

<p>
Here's what a typical top block looks like:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;!--
.. title: Looking for interesting questions
.. slug: 2010-01-03-looking-for-interesting-questions.html
.. date: 2010-01-03
.. type: text
--&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
Sed to the rescue. Here's the what I ended up typing (from within the
posts directory) to add the
<b><b>tags</b></b> slug to the top comments right above the <b><b>.. type: text:</b></b> line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ls *md *html | while read filename
do
    sed "/type: text/ i .. tags: " $filename
done
</pre></div>

<p>
A line at a time:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">ls *md *html</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This lists all the files with that end in <b><b>md</b></b> or <b><b>html</b></b>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">| while read filename</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The vertical bar (pipe) sends the output of <b><b>ls</b></b> into the <b><b>while read</b></b>
command. The <b><b>while</b></b> command sets up a loop which, each time
through, reads the next input and places into the variable
<b><b>filename</b></b>. The body of the loop is between the <b><b>do</b></b> and the
<b><b>done</b></b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">sed "/ type: text/  i .. tags: " $filename</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Sed is the stream editor. The stuff between the slashes finds the line
with the text <b><b>type: text</b></b> in it. The <b><b>i</b></b> inserts a line above and
the rest of the stuff in the quotes is what to insert. The
<b><b>$filename</b></b> expands to each filename, one each time through the
loop.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Now all of my files have blank <b><b>tag</b></b> slugs so I can find my netlogo
posts and tag them:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola tags -a netlogo `grep -i -l netlogo posts/*`
</pre></div>

<p>
Any command in backticks expands to the result of the commmand. The
grep command has two argiments: <b><b>-i</b></b> means ignore case so it will
find netlogo, NetLogo, NETLOGO, etc.. The <b><b>-l</b></b> tells grep to just
output the filenames. So, the grep command will expand to a list of
files that mention netlogo. The full command adds the netlogo tag to
all of them.
</p>

<p>
So, just a bit of quick shell scripting and I've:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>modified all old posts to accept tags.
</li>
<li>added the netlogo tag to all my netlogo posts.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find all those posts <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/netlogo">here</a>.

Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
</p>

<p>
We're busy organizing <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY's</a> first <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">hackathon</a>. It's going to be at
<a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>, where we hold our weekly <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">hacking sessions</a> but while taking
registration, we had a little program.
</p>

<p>
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story – when
people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts,
many don't show. I asked all of the applicants to confirm by filling
out a second Google doc.
</p>

<p>
Then it got to reminder time - I wanted to send an email out to all
those kids who signed up on the first form, but hadn't confirmed on
the second. 
</p>

<p>
Two Google spreadsheets with an email field. I needed all the people
on sheet 1 that weren't on sheet 2. I'm sure there's some
spreadsheet-fu that accomplishes this, but nothing I know. I also
could have written a little python script which isn't so bad, but this
was a perfect time to turn to the shell.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how a command line guy would do this.
</p>

<p>
To start, I put the emails in two files: e1 and e2. The first has
all the original applicants, the second those that confirmed.

If we put these lists together, any email that appears twice would
indicate that it's the email of someone that confirmed entry. Here we
use cat to catenate e1 and e2 and pipe them through sort.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | sort
</pre></div>

<p>
First problem –the upper case F – let's use <b><b>tr</b></b> to make
everything lower case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 |  tr A-Z a-z | sort
</pre></div>

<p>
Now we can see the duplicates next to each other. Next, <b><b>uniq
-c</b></b> tells us how many times each line appears:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort
</pre></div>

<p>
I added the sort at the end, but we didn't need it.
</p>

<p>
Here's what we get:
</p>

<p class="verse">
1 a@a.com<br>
 1 c@c.com<br>
 1 c@c.dom<br>
 1 e@e.com<br>
 1 g@g.com<br>
 1 h@hc.om<br>
 2 b@b.com<br>
 2 d@d.com<br>
 2 f@f.com<br></p>

<p>
To pull out the ones that haven't replied I used egrep with a regex
that means "any line that starts with 1 or more spaces followed by the
number 1":
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1"
</pre></div>

<p>
and finally to isolate the emails using sed which removes the spaces
and number 1 from the beginning of the line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1" | sed "s/\ \+1 //g"
</pre></div>

<p>
Each of the little utilities aren't all too useful by themselves but
if you learn them over time you start thinking about how you can
combine them to solve problems. 
</p>

<p>
If you think this way and know some basic tools, all of a sudden all
manner of text manipulation problems become pretty easy.

Over in the Facebook AP Computer Science Teachers group someone asked
for thoughts on covering BASH scripting as a post AP topic.
</p>

<p>
A number of us made suggestions. I linked to <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzR7Et9vETt">this</a> old blog post.
</p>

<p>
One group member said she asked around for similar suggestions and the
response she got was "vi and awk." I wanted to jokingly respond "and
after they suggested that they got into their time machine and went
back to the 70's."
</p>

<p>
In all seriousness though, I think that suggesting specific tools or
commands is off base.
</p>

<p>
The important thing to know about Vi is how to get out of it but it
isn't really a tool in the scripting sense. I do think students should
spend a good amount of time learning a powerful editor and should try
bot Emacs (my choice) and Vim but that's another story.
</p>

<p>
I also use AWK but as it's a programming language in it's own right,
I'm not sure if I'd introduce it right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of important ideas kids can take away from learning
some Linux (or other Unix flavor):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's something out there besides Windows and MacOS
</li>
<li>All about free software
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">The Unix Philosophy</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one is the biggie and more specifically, there's a huge
upside in teaching kids the value of "OS as Toolset" where they can
compose the many tools that comprise the Linux experience to get
things done. 
</p>

<p>
I gave an example of that in the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzSBHt9vETu">post</a> I previously linked to.
</p>

<p>
For the teacher, that means wrapping your head around that way of
working. Living in the shell and using pipes to connect program to
progarm to program.
</p>

<p>
I'd recommend getting into a time
machine ourselves and taking a look at: 
</p>


<div class="figure">

It's dated but it's really a great book on getting into the Unix way
of doing things, particularly the chapter about filters. It also has
one of the best and clearest introductions to writing a compiler in
the chapter on program development.
</p>

<p>
As I said, it is dated - shells are much easier to use and much more
robust, there are many more tools now, and they've evolved but it's
really a must read book.
</p>

<p>
In terms of tools, I get a lot of mileage out of:

A nice simple thing you can do with these is clean data. Let's say you
want to do some analytics on a book from Project Gutenberg. You might
want to convert all non letters to spaces, and all letters to lower
case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat book.txt | sed "s/[^a-zA-Z ]/ /g | tr A-Z a-z"
</pre></div>

<p>
That sends book.txt into sed which uses a regular expression to convert
no space and letters to spaces. The tr command converts all upper case
letters to lower case.
</p>

<p>
If you want one word per line, add:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "s/\n/g"
</pre></div>

<p>
and maybe get rid of blank lines:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "/^$/d"
</pre></div>

<p>
We can now count the number of words in the file using <b><b>*wc</b></b> or even
get counts of all the words:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</pre></div>

<p>
<b><b>sort</b></b> will sort all the lines, <b><b>uniq -c</b></b> will compress the lines that are
adjacent and the same and give you a count and then <b><b>sort -n</b></b> will
sort the results numerically.
</p>

<p>
I wrote another post a while ago about using the shell to detect
who responded on a Google form. It looks like it didn't convert when
I moved to my current blogging platform - I'll repost that shortly.
