<p>
In addition to everything I wrote about last time there were a couple
of other big announcements at this year's CSTA conference. Both
announcements deal with funding.
</p>

<p>
First, there is a new class of CSTA membership. The free tier remains
but now for $50 you can join <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/cstaplus">CSTA+</a>. This new level of membership comes
with a bunch of extras that are probably good for K12 teachers but I
doubt I'll use any of them. I did, however, get a snazzy CSTA+ water
bottle by joining at the conference. For me the interesting part is
that 50% of CSTA+ dues will go to support local chapters.
</p>

<p>
I don't exactly know what that means but it's what got me to
join. Ultimately, local teaching communities are important and CSTA+
supports that, I'm all in.
</p>

<p>
That said, what do chapters do? I know what goes on in NY but not
elsewhere. I bet the same is true for people all over the country. One
question that came up repeatedly at the conference, at least in my
circles was "what would the chapters use the money for?" I think it
would be wonderful if on the CSTA web site there was a page where
chapters could easily list activities funded by the central
organization. I'm not looking for a big write up - who has time to
read or write that. I'm looking for a line or two. What the chapter
did and maybe a few comments on details. Over time this could be  a
great way for chapters to steal ideas from each other.
</p>

<p>
The other piece of big news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-partnership-support-computer-science-teachers-mary-snapp-1c/?published=">Microsoft pledging a big chunk of
change to the CSTA</a>. I've often lamented that so many CS Education (and
education decisions in general) are decided by everyone except the
teachers. The CSTA is our teacher's professional organization and our
best bet for teacher representation when policy is made and
implemented. Once again it appears that some of these funds will help
support local chapters. 
</p>

<p>
The Microsoft funding though got me thinking. The linked piece talks
about advocacy, professional development and curriculum. All important but
there's an even greater need right around the corner. We need quality,
qualified CS teachers and we need them now. Taking a teacher with no
CS background and giving them some PD can be a stop gap but it isn't a
solution. Long term we need pre and in service teacher preparation
programs similar to what we're rolling out at Hunter. Programs that
include both pedagogy and content. As states begin to require these
programs, as they do in all other subject areas, teachers both new and
in service will have to take a number of graduate credits. In our
case, 18 for a certificate for an already licensed teacher and our MA
program is somewhere in the 30s. 
</p>

<p>
I'd love to see money allocated to pay for CS teacher certification
through our public colleges as they (we) roll out programs. 
</p>

<p>
This said, the Microsoft commitment is great news for the CSTA and
CSTA is a great option for teachers that can afford it.
</p>

<p>
Here in NY, our CSTA chapter is fairly young. I'm excited to see what
this year brings both on the local and national level.

I just got back from the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association)
conference. It's the biggest annual conference dedicated to K12 CS
education. I think there were about 700 people attending. It felt much
larger than last year but compared to SIGCSE which is double the size,
CSTA still felt pretty intimate.
</p>

<p>
The conference was in Omaha Devorah came along to play tourist and we both 
came a day early to do some site seeing. 
</p>

<p>
First, we hit the <a href="http://www.omahazoo.com/">zoo</a> and <a href="https://www.lauritzengardens.org/">Lauritzen Gardens</a>. We've got the Bronx Zoo
here in NY an the NY and Brooklyn Botanical Gardens which are all
pretty impressive but even so, Omaha's zoo and gardens are well worth
a visit. We then went over to the <a href="https://durhammuseum.org/">Durham Museum</a> which was really
terrific. Housed in an old railroad station, the museum has lots of
great Omaha history as well as trains and other neat exhibits.
</p>

<p>
We also walked all over and did our best to pick up on the local
flavor. One of our discoveries was a terrifically quirky
<a href="https://www.omahanostalgia.com/">retro/nostalgia/antiques</a> store. It had an awesome working Pinball
museum
</p>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/csta-2018/pinball.jpg" alt="pinball.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>
along with all the rubber ducks you'd ever want for debugging
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/csta-2018/ducks.jpg" alt="ducks.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>



<p>
and a whole lot more. 
</p>

<p>
By the river, we found both a statue and series of plaques honoring
labor:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/csta-2018/labor.jpg" alt="labor.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
something I'm thinking a lot about now in light of the recent Janus
decision.
</p>



<p>
As for the conference. It was 100% worth it. 
</p>

<p>
I spent a lot of time at the GitHub booth with my new friend  <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPhamous">John</a>
talking about how I use GitHub with my classes.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/csta-2018/git.jpg" alt="git.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
and as always one of the highlights was spending time with old friends
and making new friends while talking shop.
</p>

<p>
I also gave a talk on the state of CS teacher certification in New
York State and what we're rolling out at Hunter. that led to
discussions with people from all over. Texas, California, Indiana, and
other places. We had some great discussions as to what's going on all
over the country. I also had a chance to talk to teachers from all
over NY State to let them know how Hunter can help them.
</p>

<p>
There were also interesting sessions. I attended a BOF facilitated by
<a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Lash">Todd Lash</a> and others about mapping model lessons to CS standards. I'm
actually not a fan of "the standards" and have some serious concerns
about how standards are thrown around and used but it was a very
interesting session nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
I also enjoyed a session by Owen Astrachan on teaching sorting. Owen
gives a great talk. I didn't agree with some of how he approaches
teaching sorting but then we teach different classes and students and
could have slightly different goals leading to my view. In any case, it was very
interesting and I plan on  stealing the motivation he used. Owen
started with a list of top hits - their titles and artist names and
had us perform some mini data mining exercises on them in a
spreadsheet to motivate the concept of sorting.
</p>

<p>
Probably the highlight of the conference for me was <a href="https://twitter.com/mfh?lang=en">Michelle Friend</a>'s
keynote. She had me as soon as she encouraged us to question the value
of a lot of the education research out there. It got better when she
reminded the audience of teachers that they <b>were</b> all education
researchers. they perform their practice every day, analyze the
results, and work to improve. So often, I hear education researchers
dismiss teachers - "that's just anecdotal" they say while they
publish the "true way" while ignoring the thousands of complex factors
that actually affect education. There is some research that's great
and some researchers I greatly respect but I've been forced to read
enough bunk and there's been enough nonsense forced upon teachers over
the years that just doesn't work in practice that a healthy dose of
skepticism is critical.
</p>

<p>
Michelle also talked about assessment and how we test "what we can"
rather than what we should.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't a talk from on high but I think it's what the audience
needed - a talk from someone who's currently an academic but who at
her core, I think is a teacher. It was teacher to teacher and that's
what, at least in my opinion CSTA should be about.
</p>

<p>
A final highlight for me was when they awarded the Cutler Bell price
for high school students. I knew that Benjamin Spector &amp; Michael
Truell were winners but I didn't realize they'd be at the conference
to receive their award for their work  creating <a href="https://halite.io/">Halite</a>. I had helped
them a bit along the way so knew the quality and impact of the project
and it was great to see Ben and Mike recognized and to be there to be
able to congratulate them in person.
</p>

<p>
Now it's back home and back to reality. The organizing committee
really outdid themselves this year. Great job on CSTA 2018. I'm
already looking forward to next year.

<p>
While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend
I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being
available.
</p>

<p>
I'm no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher
first and part of the K12CS community. We're a growing community and
we're growing fast.
</p>

<p>
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their
results. "I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc." 
</p>

<p>
I decided that not only won't I be congratulating anyone on their
results this year but decided to write this quick post to say no one
should.
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying that hundreds of teachers out there don't deserve
congratulations - they do. The problem is, for everyone who's kids 
got all fours and fives, somewhere out there was a teacher who
possibly through no fault of their own had students scoring ones, twos
and threes. 
</p>

<p>
When I was at Stuy, almost all of my kids got fours or fives when the
exam was the old AB exam. When it went to A only, it was almost
exclusively fives with a few fours and maybe a single one. That wasn't
me. It was the kids. The AP CS teacher before me got similar results
as did all of my colleagues and the teachers who are still
there. Again, it was the kids.
</p>

<p>
That's not to say that I didn't add value. I know I spent a career at
Stuy doing right by those kids regardless of test scores.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that there's only so much a teacher can do.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Was APCS (A or principles) their first course?</li>
<li>What other demands are placed on the students?</li>
<li>How about the teacher?</li>
<li>How many kids in a class? How much time?</li>
<li>Is APCS an elective or required??</li>
<li>Is the teacher getting the support they need?</li>
</ul>
<p>
And the list goes on. I know some great teachers who never had classes
with great AP results and meh teachers that did. Actually, I know some
APCS and Calc teachers that consistently had classes with good scores
through drill and kill and building student speed. Of course, at the
same time these teachers totally turned the kids off from the subjects
</p>

<p>
Our teachers do deserve praise and congratulations.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Praise for getting through another year.</li>
<li>Praise for forging a path in this new subject area.</li>
<li>Praise for doing more with less.</li>
<li>Praise for inspiring kids and starting them on a path.</li>
<li>Praise for changing lives for the better.</li>
<li>And so on</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your kids left with more than they came in with you did a great job
and deserve congratulations. If you set a seed that will later grow
you've done an enormous amount of good.
</p>


<p>
It's like I would always tell my kids when they won an award. I was
never proud of them actually winning the award. I was proud of how they carried
themselves, prepared, performed or whatever. The award was just some
outsider also noticing they're awesome.
</p>

<p>
Same thing here so I won't be congratulating teachers on student test
results. The results coming in do provide some measure of closure for
the year though so I will congratulate you all on the year and your
work.
</p>

<p>
Hope to see many of you this weekend at CSTA2018.

<p>
I've taken part in a few conversations and read more than a few
threads on teacher certification exams recently. Specifically, CS
teacher certification exams. There are a bunch of them floating
around. There's the <a href="https://www.ets.org/praxis/prepare/materials/5651%0A">Praxis</a> offered by ETS, the one from the <a href="https://www.nestest.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/NT315_PrepMaterials.html%0A">National
Evaluation Series</a>,  the <a href="https://www.west.nesinc.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/WA073_PrepMaterials.html">Washington Evaluator Test Series</a> one and then
there's what's <a href="https://www.weteachcs.org/">going on in Texas</a>. NY State says it will eventually
develop their own.
</p>

<p>
I have mixed feelings about exams like these. From what I've seen some
of the content seems fine and the "stuff you have to know for the
test" isn't necessarily the worst in the world. As a one time
gatekeeper, I'm not necessarily happy with them but they can provide a
test for a basic threshold of knowledge with out too much focus on
test prep.
</p>

<p>
Of course, they're just the tip of the iceberg, many states including
New York make their teacher candidates also take other exams. In NY
candidates must take the <a href="https://dianeravitch.net/2013/06/03/what-is-edtpa-and-why-do-critics-dislike-it/">edTPA</a> which is expensive for the teacher
candidate but a big money maker for Pearsons.
</p>

<p>
All of this came out of NCLB back in the day which also created
requirements like "must complete an approved program" as opposed to
just accruing a bunch of relevant education and content credits which
in turn led to more courses like <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/">Math for Math Teachers</a>.
</p>

<p>
For you youngsters out there (which I guess is most of you), I thought
I'd share what it was like back in the day.
</p>

<p>
Back then, New York City certified it's own teachers as opposed
to now when everything's done directly through the state. The system
was, in my opinion far superior. 
</p>

<p>
I came in as a career changer - I was doing computer work at the
time - and I came in as a math teacher since there was no CS. Since
math was an area of need it was a little easier for me to get my foot
in the door than it would have been for say an English teacher.
</p>

<p>
To start I went down to the Board of Education in Brooklyn armed with
my college transcript and waited in line. I then met with someone who
evaluated my transcript. Normally, to get started, I would have needed
a certain number of education credits and a certain number of content
(math) credits. I think the magic number was 24 for the content. Since
math was an area of needed you could get started with a TPD license
(Temporary Per Diem) which required no education credits going in. You
had to get 18 graduate education credits within the first, I think two
years and take the National Teacher Exam. You also got one period off
to be mentored which was a pretty sweet deal. Of course it wouldn't be
that simple. I only had 16 math credits so fell short but the
evaluator decided to give me credit for a couple of my more mathy CS
classes like Algorithms to get me over the hump.
</p>

<p>
I then went to another line to get a brief mini physical and at some
point I was fingerprinted and I had my TPD. The BOE then ran a one
week "learn to teach" bootcamp and I was left to find my own job which
I was fortunately able to do.
</p>

<p>
So, I had my foot in the door but as a TPD I had no job protections. I
was observed at least 6 times a year and could be fired at will. In
fact, TPD's were annually given pink slips in the spring and had to be
rehired again in the Fall if their schools wanted them.
</p>

<p>
I got my 18 education credits over the next two years and took the NTE
which was both the easiest and hardest exam I ever had to
take. Easiest content wise but hard because it was a FULL DAY of non
stop writing and my hand was cramped up into a club by days end. That
got me to the next level - the PPT - Preparatory Provisional License,
I think.  This allowed me to be appointed. Once appointed you had job
retention and seniority rights. Not tenure, but a step closer and you
did get some legit job protections. If you started the process with
education credits to go along with content credits you could have
started directly with the PPT. 
</p>

<p>
The final step to get that appointment with the PPT is that you had to
go for an interview with the <b>Board of Examiners</b>. This was the good
part. After work one day I went down to Brooklyn Tech, waited my turn
and then was ushered into a classroom. A typical panel would have a
principal, an assistant principal in your subject area, and a couple
of teachers, again in your subject area. They could grill you on
anything they wanted. 
</p>

<p>
They could ask you general teaching questions (usually cached in a scenario):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how do yo u handle a mixed level class,</li>
<li>how do you handle a disruptive student</li>
</ul>
<p>
Preparation questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how would you motivate a  class on the Pythagorean Theorem?</li>
<li>How would you turn a lesson on solving quadratics in to a hands on
lab experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>
or content questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>solve this calculus problem…</li>
<li>Derive this theorem…</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't remember how long the session lasted but afterwards I left and
a couple of weeks later, I had my PPT and was appointed. 
</p>

<p>
There were a couple of last steps - tenure, which pretty much just
happened since my AP and Principal were both happy with my performance
and I had to get my Masters. Back then you could get a Masters in
anything so I decided to get it in CS rather than Education. 
</p>


<p>
There was a lot to like about the old system. I've never been a big
fan of a lot of the education credits one has to get and while I still
needed a number of them, I'm glad I had the option to take mostly
content credits. I also like what amounted to being evaluated face to
face by an individual rather than an amorphous bureaucracy. I also
loved the mentoring I got but while the system gave me the class
relief time to allow it to happen I think much of the value was due to
my colleagues at Seward Park High School without whom I would have
washed out. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest thing I liked was the Board of Examiners. I found it
somewhat stressful since I was never a math guy but the idea that
you've got to prove yourself to a bunch of local city educators was
HUGE. You weren't expected to give the "correct for the test" answer,
you had to convince people that you might have to work for or with
that you got the goods.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure we'll never go back to the old days but I thought the current
generation might be interested in hearing what it was like back in the
day.

As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer
Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I've been a member of
CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I've
made it to the annual conference.
</p>

<p>
The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for
k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from
conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education
research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech
conference.
</p>

<p>
I really enjoyed the conference last year but as the sessions seemed
to be weighted towards beginning CS teachers and towards the CSTA
standards I found most of the value in the "hallway track" when I got
to meet and chat with CS teachers from all over the country.
</p>

<p>
Glancing at the program, there looks to be a bunch of interesting
sessions and this time more sessions that I think I'll personally be
interested in . 
</p>

<p>
I'm also giving a talk. New York State just approved and created K12
Computer Science Teacher Certification and we're currently making
plans to roll out our Masters and Certificate programs for CS teachers
as soon as we get state approval. The Masters program will be largely
for preservice teacher candidates and the certificate program for in
service teachers certified in other areas. 
</p>

<p>
The talk will cover a bit of the history of CS Education in New York,
what the state is doing and mostly what where building at Hunter and
why. It should be a fun talk. I'm hoping for some people from other
states attend so we can have a rich discussion during the session.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're going to be at the CSTA conference, I'd love to see
you either at my session or at the conference in general. I'll be
spending most of my non session time there with my friends at GitHub
education.
</p>

<p>
For those of you can't make it, I hope to blog about the weekend and I
hope others do as well.

Next weekend I'll be attending the Computer Science Teachers
Association's <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference">annual conference.</a> It's probably the biggest conference
focussed on K12 Computer Science education. This year, in addition to
attending, I'll be giving a talk on preservice and inservice CS
teacher preparation programs. I'll be talking about the new New York
State certification requirements along with what we're rolling out at
Hunter College. 
</p>

<p>
This means putting together a slide deck for the session. When I have
to work collaboratively with non-Emacs users, I will usually go to
Google Docs for presentations. It works and the collaborative aspects
are nice but tools like Google Docs and Powerpoint are designed around
composing slides manually. I much prefer to use a tool where I can
focus on writing my presentation and have the tool turn it into a
presentation.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode is of course the ideal tool. As an outliner, it lends itself
to organizing a talk:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* topic 1
   the content for slide one
* topic 2
   the content for slide two
* topic 3
   etc.
</pre></div>

<p>
I can embed code, tables, images, and more. I can also cycle
visibility so I can focus on individual sections. Org-mode also has a
number of export options to take a plain org file which is just ascii
with markup and export it as a presentation. In the video, I'll take a
quick look at <code>ox-beamer</code>, which exports to a Beamer presentation in LaTeX and then a PDF,
<code>epresent</code> which presents right in Emacs and finally <code>ox-reveal</code> wich
creates a <code>reveal.js</code> presentation. I ultimately decide to continue to
use <code>ox-reveal</code> as it's pretty simple and flexible and I can also directly serve
the final presentation from my own laptop, a usb drive, or directly
from GitHub. 
</p>

<p>
Check out the video to see how. If you want more information on using
<code>ox-reveal</code> check out my earlier <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-11-reveal">Using Emacs post and video</a>.

Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for
Hunter's incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time
all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be
my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we've come in under three
years. 
</p>

<p>
Hunter's had a strong but little known undergraduate
CS program for as long as I've known. Much like any program, we've got
our strengths and weaknesses but you go through our program and
academically you'll be as well prepared as from anywhere else. We have some
challenges being a commuter school, a liberal arts school and a school
not commonly thought of for CS but the core has always been there.  
</p>

<p>
Hunter has been making a concerted effort to up its computer science
game and my joining the team has been part of that. The Daedalus
program is an honors scholarship program. It's similar to the well
known CUNY Macaulay program but it's specific to Hunter and specific to
CS. Our kids get scholarships, laptops, special classes (with me),
activities and events and more. Our first cohort had 12. This past
year we had 23 but a funny thing happened right after we started. Hunter's
Macaulay CS students heard about what was going on and wanted in. The
end result was that last years cohort had a total of 27 students
as we invited the incoming Hunter Macaulay CS students into the
fold. This year, we're up to about 50 total and it looks to be a very
strong group. To be honest I'm a little
scared of growing this quickly. The kids will be great but it will be
a challenge building the community across multiple classes. 
</p>

<p>
I'm really pleased with the first two cohorts performance both in
class and out. They're progressing well through the academic program
and are ahead of schedule in terms of internships and outside
activities but I'm even happier that they've been working to level up
Hunter CS as a whole. They started a once a week Dojo last year where
all Hunter CS students could hang out and work on tech projects and
have a speaker series on tap for this coming year. For my part, I've
got a couple of new ideas up my sleeve but I'm going to keep them
under wraps for now.
</p>

<p>
Three years ago Hunter wasn't so much on the map for CS inclined high
school students and while there's much work to be done, many of our
incoming cohort members chose us over other programs that have
traditionally been considered CS strongholds.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, our efforts to connect Hunter CS to the NY Tech community have begun to
raise our profile on the other end of the pipeline.
</p>

<p>
There's still a long rode ahead but I thought I'd give myself a day to
look back on how far we've come in a short time. Having a great public college option for CS
education is critical for NYC. This was one of the things I left Stuy to
accomplish and we're well on our way.

I saw a couple of tweets from Sarah Judd this morning:
</p>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>
It wasn't the first time I've heard this refrain. Last year I attended
my first CSTA conference. I had numerous conversations with CS
teachers on the fact that everything was on an intro level in terms of
both content and teaching. Further conversations with local teachers
with stronger CS backgrounds led me to run a professional development
session at Hunter this past election day for more experienced CS
teachers at schools that offered more than the basics.
</p>

<p>
While it's not surprising that most of the PD opportunities for CS teachers are
rather rudimentary given that nationally most programs are new and
most teachers are new to the subject but there are a few deeper
reasons.
</p>

<p>
To start, there are big players in the CS Ed movement that are pushing
curricula and specific programs and that leads to scripted PD for
their products and not depth of knowledge nor deep pedagogical content
knowledge let alone basic pedagogy. Add to this the fact that many of
the "thought leaders" in the space don't have experience teaching CS
at the K12 level and in many cases don't have a background either in
teaching nor tech and you can see where the problem comes from. On top
of this we have the erosion of respect for teaching as a profession
where reformers are trying to take the teacher out of teaching and are
trying to reduce pedagogy to following scripts. This problem goes well
beyond CS Ed but as the new kid on the block it probably hits us
hardest.
</p>

<p>
In any case, preparing beginners is both necessary and appropriate for
the time being but we can and must do a better job than what's
currently "state of the art." At the same time we have to do something
with the CS teachers who indeed do have strong content knowledge but
don't feel comfortable with imparting that knowledge.
</p>

<p>
So, what should we do?
</p>

<p>
For new teachers the solution will ultimately have to come
from pre-service programs but what we end up getting is going to
largely be dictated on what's required by individual states. If states
merely require passing an exam like the Praxis CS exam which, from
what I can gather isn't a horrible content exam then we're going to
see CS teachers bumble through their early to mid careers while trying
to figure out how to teach CS much like I did way back when. If they
end up endorsing pre-service programs that are focused on specific
curricula - APCS-A for teachers, APCS-P for teachers, <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/">Math for Math
teachers</a> if you will but for CS, we're also not going to get strong
well prepared pedagogues. On the other hand if you can design a
program that has a strong pedagogical component to go along with the
content, you have a chance. Even with a well designed program
implementation will still be a challenge. Who will teach it? Education
professors who don't have CS backgrounds? CS professors with little
pedagogical training? Neither of those groups necessarily have any
real experience as actual K12 teachers. If you can find honest to
goodness experienced, strong K12 CS teachers to teach your pedagogy
courses that's a big win but that's going to be hard in most cases. 
</p>

<p>
I think we designed a great program at Hunter and have a practical and
strong implementation plan. If you're going to be
at CSTA2018 you can hear all about it and why we designed it as we did
in the talk I'm giving. 
</p>

<p>
For the more experienced I don't have a universal answer but I can say
what I'm planning. Teachers in NY have to complete 100 CTLE hours
every five years. For beginners, there are plenty of options, at least
content wise. For teachers who know CS, not so much. I was at a meetup
talking to a few friends a couple of weeks ago and one mentioned that
they get most of their hours in Math for America CS
workshops. Unfortunately more than a few of my CS teacher friends who
are in MFA tell me that the CS content in these workshops, while they
do satisfy the hours, are somewhat lacking on the CS / CS pedagogy
side.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I'm planning - we (Hunter) will host a once a month
dinner/session for CS teachers who are a little farther along CS
wise. I haven't worked out all the details yet but I've got a few tech
companies that are already interested in sponsoring and helping out
should we need anything and we'll probably set most of our agenda for
the year at the first session where I'll make my best guess at a
useful agenda. This is something I'm pretty excited about. It should
help create a network of more experienced CS teachers which will both
help bolster that segment of the community and provide a long term
resource to newcomers and it should be a lot of fun.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, this is why I ended up joining Hunter. Regardless of
what the city and state do, we're going to prepare the teachers and if
you have a well prepared teacher, you've got a shot.

I've been using Emacs for email for a couple of years now. Not for
everything, for now my personal email is still Gmail but work is sent
and read through Emacs. I'm currently using <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu4e</a> and while it has a
few quirks and limitations, I like it very much. You can take a look
on how I configure and use it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-39-mu4e/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The other day I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8qryri/mu4econversation_single_buffer_fullthread_display/">this</a> thread on Emacs about a new package -
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/mu4e-conversation">mu4e-conversation</a>. It's a package that deals with email threads.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty cool. You can invoke it whenever you're in the headers
view you can just run <code>M-x mu4e-conversation</code> and it combines all the
email messages in the current thread into a single buffer. 
</p>

<p>
It's pretty nice. 
</p>

<p>
You can navigate between messages in the thread with <code>C-c C-n</code> and
<code>C-c C-p</code> and use most if not all of the usual mu4e goodness but on
top of that you can also toggle what the author calls tree mode by
hitting <code>V</code>. Tree mode turns the thread into an org-mode tree - also
extremely cool.
</p>

<p>
On top of this, you can also make mu4e your default viewing mode by
setting a single variable with <code>(setq mu4e-view-func 'mu4e-conversation)</code>.
</p>


<p>
Although it's very cool, I'm not sure if mu4e-conversation will find
its way into my workflow or not and probably won't know for a
while. This is mostly due to the fact that it's summer so work email
slows down and I won't have too many long threads to play with this
on.
</p>

<p>
I'll report back once I give it a fair shake but in the meantime if
anyone out there has had the time to play with it, let us know what
you think.

Time to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging.
</p>

<p>
Last week, in Garth Flint's post about his <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/747/">summer plans</a>, Garth
mentioned wanting to get his head around Object Oriented Programming
and possibly taking a course to help him get there. I thought I'd talk
a little about how I got my head around OOP here and some of the
difficulties I faced then and what people might face now.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, kids are faced with OOP pretty early on. If they take APCS-A
they're using Java which is Object Oriented. Same if they start
at a college using Java. If they start with C++ or Python they may or
may not see objects early on. In any event, the nature of that first
course doesn't really lend itself to really grokking OOP. Even if a
student takes a class prior to APCS-A or it's college equivalent,
they're pretty y raw. Small programs with just a few constructs don't
really show the uses of OOP. Both inheritance and interfaces can feel
forced in a first year course and when the examples are artificial and
wonky and their are easier ways to accomplish the same task, it's hard
for a student to really buy into the paradigm.
</p>

<p>
Now, in all fairness, I'm not a big fan of Object Oriented Programming
and it's usually not the first tool I go to. That said, it's a useful
tool and it has it's place.
</p>

<p>
I cut my teeth in the 1980s. I went to the Courant Institute at
NYU. The core language back then was Pascal which had a number of
limitations including only supporting single file programs. Somewhere
along the line I taught myself C which most professors were happy to
accept assignments in. I never heard of OOP in my formal
schooling. Some time near or soon after I graduated I had heard of
this C++ thing but hadn't used it.
</p>

<p>
After working my way through school I spent some time as a developer
at Goldman Sachs. I was the only guy on my team doing Windows 2.1
development. Windows 2.1 was built on top of DOS. It's big improvement
over Windows 1.0 was that it supported overlapping windows. Pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
I learned to program Windows like everyone else:
</p>

<p><img src="http://www.charlespetzold.com/oop/pw1.png" alt="pw1.png" width="200px" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
It was all done in C. The big project I was on was for Global
Equities. Specifically, supporting trading of Japanese Warrants. I had
to write a trading system and in doing that implement among other
things a mini spreadsheet in C from bare metal.
</p>

<p>
This was probably going to be the most complex thing I designed and
built from scratch to date. I had a bunch of cells that were
associated with either rows or columns or both and all sorts of
complex interactions. I needed a way to manage complexity and even
though I didn't use the term at the time, manage state. 
</p>

<p>
C doesn't have a lot of fancy in language constructs to help and I was
somewhat on an island - I taught myself C and there weren't any
experienced C / Windows programmers in my group or on my floor so I
had to figure things out on my own.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I came up with, or rather something like what I came up
with – it was close to 30 years ago and I don't even remember 100% of
what it was supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
I decided to create a single file for each concept -
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cell.c / cell.h for cells</li>
<li>row.c / row.h for rows</li>
<li>sheet.c / sheet.h for</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In each, I would do something like this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cm">/* sheet.c */</span>


<span class="cm">/* things declared here are "global" but limited to this file **/</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">sheets</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* an array of the sheets */</span>

<span class="cm">/* functions that will be made available to other files */</span>

<span class="cm">/* return a pointer to the named sheet */</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="nf">sheet_get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">){</span>
<span class="cm">/* implementation */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/* create a new sheet */</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nf">sheet_create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">cols</span><span class="p">){</span>
<span class="cm">/* implementation/</span>
<span class="cm">}</span>

<span class="cm">/* functions that will only be used internally */</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">allocate_sheet_memory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">cols</span><span class="p">){</span>
<span class="cm">/*implementation*/</span>
<span class="p">}</span>


<span class="cm">/* etc */</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cm">/* sheet.h */</span>

<span class="cm">/* </span>
<span class="cm">   Note that only the headers for the exterrnally available stuff is included</span>
<span class="cm">*/</span>


<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nf">sheet_get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">sheet</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nf">sheet_create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">cols</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The idea is that everything about a sheet is in <code>sheet.c</code> and only a
few functions are made available to the rest of the program via the
header file. 
</p>

<p>
Shortly after I designed the program, I started to delve into OOP at
the encouragement of some colleagues. I read Meyer:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392538685l/3328934.jpg" alt="3328934.jpg" width="200px" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
and the first edition of Booch: 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/bigcovers/0/8/0/5/0805353402.jpg" alt="0805353402.jpg" width="200px" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
I realized that in a way I was implementing singleton objects in
C. The file declared the object. The functions I exposed via the
header files were public, the other functions private and the "global"
variables that were local to the file, private class variables.
</p>

<p>
There was no inheritance but it did help me encapsulate functionality
and state. 
</p>

<p>
It turns out I saw something like this when I briefly looked at Ada. I
think it was called Object Typed Programming - objects with only a
single instance and no inheritance. 
</p>

<p>
The books gave me the official names for things but the project I was
developing gave me the context to where it all made sense. I had a
problem to solve that didn't lend itself to a low level imperative
language but you work with the tools you have and this is what I came
up with.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it's harder for beginners as projects are smaller and
while there are good small example of OOP there's also so much going
on in a course like APCS-A. It gets more convoluted when you're using
Python or C++ as you might be shown Objects in a C++ class while
professor is really teaching C with Objects rather than doing things
the C++ way. 
</p>

<p>
One thing that helps is using a language or tool where objects make
sense. NetLogo - used in Stuy's intro course is a nice one. Turtles
and patches - the inhabitants of the NetLogo can be viewed as
objects. I'd draw heavily on NetLogo analogies when teaching APCS at
Stuy. There are also tools like BlueJ which is tied closely to objects
and is probably terrific at giving structure to help objects make
sense but I don't like those types of tools for other reasons.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, it is just a tool and to be honest, I'm not
really a big fan of OOP. I'll use it but it's not my go to paradigm.
</p>

<p>
I'll leave you with this video which talks about why:
