<p>
Both at and prior to SIGCSE 2017, I promised to write up the steps I
take to introduce and use revision control systems in my classes. 
</p>

<p>
This series is not meant to be a git or <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> tutorial. There are
plenty of those already (two of which I've linked to below).  This is
about the process I use with my students to get them up to speed. 
</p>

<p>
As with any new tool, there will be some resistance but once git saves
them once, they get religion. There will also be some bumps in the
road but at the end of the day, the students will be using a valuable
and necessary tool. 
</p>

<p>
I was also surprised at the ancillary benefits I got as a teacher by
using GitHub in particular. I'll talk about that at the end of the
series.
</p>


<p>
Here's part one. 
</p>

<p>
I'm doing this with git and GitHub but there's no reason why other
systems and hosts can't be used. I'd also recommend that any educator
or student sign up for the assorted <a href="https://education.github.com/">discounts</a> offered by GitHub.
</p>

<p>
I've followed this basic idea multiple times and done it over the
course of a single semester, a year, and even two years. Regardless of
time frame, the idea is the same. Make each step simple and relevant
and introduce complexity and roadblocks a piece at a time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Step 1 - code distribution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
To start, I don't even talk about version control. We start with code
distribution. For years, I've looked for efficient ways of sharing
code with my classes. Both code developed in class and code for
assignments. 
</p>

<p>
I've tried things like NFS, Dropbox, online code repositories like the
files section of systems like Moodle or Blackboard.
</p>

<p>
At Stuy, we've always had efficiency problems with NFS and Dropbox has
multiple problems ranging from students not being able to install the
client on school machines to the problems of the network hit when a
room full of kids are syncing at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Uploading to a CMS system was also problematic - I'm a command line
wonk and hate going through slow web page menus to navigate a
filesystem and upload files. I also had to remember to get the files
off of whatever machine I was working on in class and then transfer
them to the CMS when I had a free moment.
</p>

<p>
Enter git. Now, of course, if you're going to use git in the classroom
you have to know it. There are plenty of resources out there. Online
courses, articles, videos, and tutorials. Here are a couple:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://try.github.io/">https://try.github.io/</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also want to point out that I just use raw command line git along
with native GitHub. GitHub has rolled out <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> which adds
a layer of support for educators. I don't use it because, as I said,
I'm an old school command line wonk and also because I figured out a
sequence that worked for me and my students before GitHub Classroom
existed. Were I starting now, I'd take some time to look at their
current offerings before jumping in.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Set up</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Before starting, make sure you register your ssh keys. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">This</a> help page
has more information. You'll want to register an ssh key from every
machine you use - home, work, laptop. 
</p>


<p>
Now go over to GitHub and make a new repository. I usually name it
<b><b>classcode</b></b>. <b><b>BEGINNER NOTE:</b></b> when creating the repo, make sure to
check the "initialize this repository with a README" box. If you don't
you'll be given a set of instructions on how to set things up once you
click <b><b>Create repository</b></b> but it's easier and easier to follow if
you start with an initialized repo with a README.
</p>

<p>
I make the repo public – it's code I'm distributing – nothing to
hide here. If you aren't comfortable with that, just make the repo
private. If you've registered as a teacher with GitHub, you can set up
an organization and you'll be able to set up free private repos within
it. The other downside here is that you'll have to individually give
each student access to the repo. That's a mild annoyance but it only
has to be done once.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Teacher use</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Next, clone out the repo. <b><b>BEGINNER NOTE:</b></b> Make sure you check out
the ssh version not the https version. Just make sure that when you
click the <b><b>clone</b></b> button, it says "Clone with SSH." If not, just
click the "Use SSH" link in the same box. Students will clone the
using https.
</p>

<p>
From the teacher point of view, you can just start using the repo. My
work flow is typically:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>
<b><b>git pull</b></b> at the start of class
</li>
<li>write code throughout class
</li>
<li>
<b><b>git add</b></b>, <b><b>git commit</b></b>, and <b><b>git push</b></b> at the end of class
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I use a similar flow when I want to add files in my office or at home.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Student use</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
From the student point of view, assuming a public repo, they just have to clone the repo and
at the beginning of every class or work session, do a <b><b>git
pull</b></b>. That's all there is to it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Thoughts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
That's it. The kids are now using GitHub – they're probably looking
at and poking around on the web site as well as pulling files to their
machines. You can also, in class, show things like <b><b>git status</b></b>,
<b><b>git log</b></b>, and <b><b>git diff</b></b> to set the stage for step 2 of this
process and beyond.
</p>

<p>
Since the students aren't adding, committing or pushing, you probably won't
get any errors. 
</p>

<p>
The only problem that could reasonably occur is if a student places a
file in their local copy of the repo with the same name as something
they haven't pulled yet. This is pretty easy to address and provides a
nice stepping stone lesson to again, set the stage for more complex
operations.
</p>


<p>
I'm happy with this as a first step towards git using GitHub. It
provides a nice way of sharing class code while gently introducing the
students to the tool.
</p>

<p>
The next step  is having the students add files to a repo. That's the
next post in this series.

As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the
conference of the ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer Science
Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and
the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the
proceedings and read many of the papers.
</p>

<p>
Now that I'm at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in
Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday. I was
part of a panel on "Tools we can't live without." Over the next few
weeks, I hope to blog about a number of things I thought and talked
with people about over the conference including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The path I use to teach git and why GitHub a good teaching tool
(my talk).
</li>
<li>The relationship of different CS Ed stakeholders - teachers,
researchers, organizations, etc.
</li>
<li>Teaching at the high school level vs college - perceptions and
reality.
</li>
<li>The challenges of tech tool adoption in schools.
</li>
<li>What's going on in K12 CS Certification.
</li>
<li>Maybe some other stuff.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Today, some overall thoughts.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The good</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
As with many conferences, the "hallway track" along with receptions
sponsored by <a href="https://csnyc.org/our-work/cs4all">the CS4All consurtium</a>, <a href="http://tealsk12.org">TEALS</a>, <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> were terrific. I
was able to finally meet in person many people who I've only known
virtually and got to know many more as well. I left the conference
with a much larger address book and a long list of follow up
items. Being in Seattle, I also enjoyed being able to spend time with
people from <a href="http://tealsk12.org">TEALS</a> and <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a>, two of the CS Ed groups working hard
to do some real good (yes - I do like and support these guys even
though I call them out on things I disagree with, but that's the
subject of another post). 
</p>

<p>
I attended sessions on CS certification, teacher preparation,
assessments, POGIL based instruction to name a few. They ranged from
valuable to interesting and to be honest, a couple of "what were they
thinking" but the overall experience was very much worth the trip. I
also got to speak to a number of wonderful students at the
poster sessions.
</p>

<p>
The keynotes are also well worth a read (sorry if you don't have ACM
digital library access). <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025045&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Jeannette Wing</a> talked about the importance of
probability and statistics in CS Ed, and aspects of  <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025047&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Gail Chapman</a>'s talk
"Inspire, Innovate, and Improve…" keynote and <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025046&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Mitch Resnick</a>'s
"Fulfilling Papert's Dream" both spoke to the educator inside me. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">The bad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The biggest downside to me was that I found very little value added in
a number of the paper sessions over just reading the papers. Part of
this is probably because of my own over-inflated expectations given the
number of years I've waited to attend. Part of it though, was the fact
that sessions were so tightly packed that I didn't have time to follow
up with presenters before having to run to the next
thing. Unfortunately, in some
cases, it was because the presenter merely
"read" the paper much as a professor sometimes just reads the slides
or the book to his class.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Other thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
One paper presentation I very much liked was <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3017701&amp;CFID=738971273&amp;CFTOKEN=22106692">Exam Wrappers: Not a
Silver Bullet</a> presented by <a href="https://michellecraig.github.io/">Michelle Craig</a> and <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~bdstephe/">Ben Stephenson</a>. I
actually came in late since I was hustling over from the Code.org
lunch. The result was that I didn't actually know what "Exam Wrappers"
were until well after the talk when I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/jkhuggins">Jim Huggins</a>. Exam
wrappers, in short, are merely when you require the students fill out something
for some credit when picking up their exams. The funny thing is that
it's a strategy that high school teachers have used for years without
a special name and we already knew the good and bad of it without the
research but that's not what I want to get at here. What I loved about
the talk, besides the fact that Ben and Michelle are clearly strong
presenters is that this was a negative result that was being
presented. I also loved the fact that they didn't present their
research as gospel but rather pointed out the strengths and weaknesses
of their approach - they made a case to what and why we should pay
attention to and what should be taken with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
This was a major breath of fresh air after being exposed to so much
education 'research' over the course of my life that the author or
presenter felt was just as strong as a mathematical proof rather than
an indication based on a specific experience or small set of
experiences.
</p>

<p>
I also felt a little weird at times during the week when west coast people seemed
to know me. I know I'm a loud mouthed curmudgeon and I go on my
periodic ed rants but given the dearth of comments on this blog I was
really surprised to get as many as "great to meet you in person after
reading your blog" or "we know you and your work" all week. It was
weird and somewhat humbling.
</p>

<p>
Finally, another highlight f`or me was that I got to catch up with
some of family.
