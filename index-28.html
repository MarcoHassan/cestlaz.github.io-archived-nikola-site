Since the demise of Google Reader, I've been using <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> to read my
streams. Feedly's a nice product and it's been working well for me for
quite some time. 
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, I decided to see what emacs had to offer on the feed
reader front. One solution was Gnus but then I've never been able to
get my head around Gnus. Another was <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd give elfeed a go. 
</p>

<p>
Combined with elfeed-goodies and elfeed-org it's a pretty nice
solution. You can easily search by either keywords or tags and tags
are particularly easy to set up with elfeed-org. 
</p>

<p>
If I want to display all the items from the last month, I hit <b><b>s</b></b> (for
search) and enter the query:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago
</pre></div>

<p>
For only unread posts:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago +unread
</pre></div>

<p>
For unread posts tagged emacs:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago +unread +emacs
</pre></div>

<p>
And for everything in the past 24 hours, read or not:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@1-day-ago
</pre></div>

<p>
It's pretty easy and pretty slick. The only thing missing is easy
single key navigation. There's one solution to that problem over at
<a href="http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/read-your-rss-feeds-in-emacs-with-elfeed/">Pragmatic Emacs</a> and I'll present another one in the next two posts.
</p>

<p>
I'm using some of the code from pragmatic emacs (the functions that start
with <b><b>bjm</b></b>) which makes things easier when sharing the elfeed
database on Dropbox (see the Pragmatic Emacs post above for details) and also a couple of routines I found via web
search).

I've been planning to put together a response to <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a>'s
recent post - <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html">Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality</a>. 
</p>

<p>
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
</p>

<p>
Before getting to "does it matter," I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent <a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc">IOI results</a> and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we're doing fine.
</p>

<p>
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country's producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don't encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team. 
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I've known some very smart and talented individuals
who've excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I've known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn't call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they're not the ones
who've gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they're not necessarily the ones who've
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
I don't argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they're only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock's laws of startups - <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">law 9</a>).
</p>


<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">
<img width="30%" src="http://media3.cdn.builtinchicago.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/images/BATMAN-THEN-ROBIN.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>
Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like <a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/">Dream it. Code it. Win it.</a>, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
</p>

<p>
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They'll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I'd love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I'd also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools. 
</p>

<p>
I also think there's a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
</p>

<p>
I'm working on building Hunter College's honors CS program and while I
can't move the Hunter curriculum, I'm seeking that balance in my own
way.
</p>

<p>
Will we get there? I don't know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we'll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we'll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn't be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won't do much, however for the
rest of the students. I'm not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there's a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don't seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won't become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon.

    <p>
Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy's intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don't recommend it in many
cases.
</p>

<p>
Scheme certainly isn't mainstream. That's not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It's less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I've had a student with a background in Scheme, they've been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class. 
</p>

<p>
I like scheme because it's simple. It looks different than other
languages but is <code>(+ 3 4)</code> really that different than <code>add(3,4)</code> or
<code>3+4</code>? 
</p>

<p>
We can tell kids "everything's a function." While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn't, it's close enough for our
purposes. Everything's a function and the way we write a function is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">f</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Apply function <b><b>f</b></b> on arguments <b><b>b c …</b></b>. So we have <code>(+ 2 3)</code> to
add 2 and 3, <code>(and a b)</code> for logical and <code>(= 3 4)</code> to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In scheme, it would be:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">&gt; </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="mi">5</span>
  <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Even though we're fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="nv">add2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
where <code>(lambda (a b) (+ a b))</code> returns a function that adds <b><b>a</b></b> and
<b><b>b</b></b> and <code>define</code> associates it with the identifier <b><b>add2</b></b>. Now we
can use the function: <code>(add2 5 10)</code> which evaluates to 15.
</p>

<p>
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it's off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
Of course this wouldn't work had DrScheme (now <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
</p>

<p>
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
</p>

<p>
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn't as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
</p>

<p>
It also didn't hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
</p>

<p>
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don't get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrapworld</a>
is a terrific program).
</p>

<p>
In any event, if you're a high school CS teacher and  haven't played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.

I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of "why don't you start them with Javascript?" 
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I'd get similar pushback but then it
was "why not Java?", "why not C?", or "whu not C++?"
</p>

<p>
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don't like Javascript as a first language and I thought I'd share some
of them here. I'll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
</p>

<p>
To start, let me say that I <b><b>Love</b></b> Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
</p>

<p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ubiquity and availability:

<p>
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it's also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Interactivity:

<p>
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
</p>
</li>

<li>It's mainstream
</li>

<li>It's quick to get up and running
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
</p>

<p>
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like <a href="http://www.drjava.org/">DrJava</a>, <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a>, and
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven't found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There's no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
</p>

<p>
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
</p>

<p>
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have <code>=</code>, and <code>==</code>
which is pretty conventional, but then there's also <code>===</code>. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
</p>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'53'</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// '533</span>

it's a riot.
</p>

<p>
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript's got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it's easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
</p>

<p>
Finally, the fact that Javascript's a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who've at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
"everyone knows this but me." A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
</p>

<p>
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It's just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.
