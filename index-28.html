In <i>part 2</i> I talked about how I used <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hyrdas</a> to quickly navigate through
elfeed tags. It was a nice step up but the fact that I still had to
manually edit my configuration code for every new tag to update the
hydra was a problem.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I had to somehow or other, take a list of all the active
tags and with it build a <b><b>defhydra</b></b> command that will then make my
Hydra.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, emacs, being a lisp, has macros. I'm not talking about
keyboard macros which I talked about in <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-15-macros/#.WLbj5t9idKQ">episode 15</a> but rather <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LispMacro">Lisp
style macros</a>. Macros let you transform code and then execute the
transformed code. 
</p>

<p>
The example I give in the video:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defmacro</span> <span class="nv">infix</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">op</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">op</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">infix</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="nv">+</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; evaluates to 11</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This transforms the <b><b>3+8</b></b> into <b><b>(+ 3 8)</b></b> and then evaluates it to
be 11.
</p>

<p>
We can use this idea with our Hydra.
</p>

<p>
We can use the call <b><b>elfeed-db-get-all-tags</b></b> to get a list of all
the tags in our database. I decided that if I had an uppercase letter
in the tag, I'd use the lowercase version of that letter as my "hotkey"
and if it didn't, I'd just use the first letter.
</p>

<p>
So, given a tag list of:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">active</span> <span class="nv">blogs</span> <span class="nv">cs</span> <span class="nv">eDucation</span> <span class="nv">emacs</span> <span class="nv">local</span> <span class="nv">misc</span> <span class="nv">sports</span> <span class="nv">star</span> <span class="nv">tech</span> <span class="nv">unread</span> <span class="nv">webcomics</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I'd want a "hotkey" of <b><b>b</b></b> for logs and <b><b>d</b></b> for eDucation.
</p>

<p>
The routine <b><b>z/hasCap</b></b> tests to see if a tag has a capital letter in
it and <b><b>z/get-hydra-option-key</b></b> returns the final "hotkey:"
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defun z/hasCap (s) ""
       (let ((case-fold-search nil))
       (string-match-p "[[:upper:]]" s)
       ))


(defun z/get-hydra-option-key (s)
  "returns single upper case letter (converted to lower) or first"
  (interactive)
  (let ( (loc (z/hasCap s)))
    (if loc
	(downcase (substring s loc (+ loc 1)))
      (substring s 0 1)
    )))
</pre></div>


<p>
<b><b>mz/make-elfeed-cats</b></b> takes a list of tags and returns a list of
items where each item is in the form expected by the hydra definition:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"t"</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elfeed-search-set-filter</span> <span class="s">"@6-months-ago +tagname"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">"tagname"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defun</span> <span class="nv">mz/make-elfeed-cats</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tags</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="s">"Returns a list of lists. Each one is line for the hydra configuratio in the form</span>
<span class="s">     (c function hint)"</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">interactive</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">mapcar</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tag</span><span class="p">)</span>
	    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let* </span><span class="p">(</span>
		   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">tagstring</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">symbol-name</span> <span class="nv">tag</span><span class="p">))</span>
		   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">c</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">z/get-hydra-option-key</span> <span class="nv">tagstring</span><span class="p">))</span>
		   <span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list </span><span class="nv">c</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">append </span><span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">elfeed-search-set-filter</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">format</span> <span class="s">"@6-months-ago +%s"</span> <span class="nv">tagstring</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">))</span><span class="nv">tagstring</span>  <span class="p">)))</span>
	  <span class="nv">tags</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Finally, here's our macro:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defmacro</span> <span class="nv">mz/make-elfeed-hydra</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defhydra</span> <span class="nv">mz/hydra-elfeed</span> <span class="p">()</span>
     <span class="s">"filter"</span>
     <span class="o">,@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">mz/make-elfeed-cats</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elfeed-db-get-all-tags</span><span class="p">))</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"*"</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elfeed-search-set-filter</span> <span class="s">"@6-months-ago +star"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">"Starred"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"M"</span> <span class="nv">elfeed-toggle-star</span> <span class="s">"Mark"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"A"</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elfeed-search-set-filter</span> <span class="s">"@6-months-ago"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">"All"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"T"</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">elfeed-search-set-filter</span> <span class="s">"@1-day-ago"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">"Today"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Q"</span> <span class="nv">bjm/elfeed-save-db-and-bury</span> <span class="s">"Quit Elfeed"</span> <span class="nv">:color</span> <span class="nv">blue</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"q"</span> <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="s">"quit"</span> <span class="nv">:color</span> <span class="nv">blue</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The line that starts with <b>*,@*</b> calls the routine that builds lines
of code for all the tags in the database and the macro leaves me with
the defhydra I need.
</p>


<p>
I then redefine the hydra every time I need it, just in case tags
changed:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defun mz/make-and-run-elfeed-hydra ()
  ""
  (interactive)
  (mz/make-elfeed-hydra)
  (mz/hydra-elfeed/body))
</pre></div>


<p>
and bind <b><b>mz/make-and-run-elfeed-hydra</b></b> to j and J in my elfeed
keymap (this code goes in the bind section of my use-package elfeed
section):
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"j"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">mz/make-and-run-elfeed-hydra</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"J"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">mz/make-and-run-elfeed-hydra</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
As long as I remember to name my tags in a way that they don't
conflict with one another I can quickly navigate all around elfeed.
</p>

<p>
Macros FTW!!!!

<blockquote>
<p>
If we properly prepare CS teachers, won't they just jump ship and take
tech industry jobs?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I hear that a lot.
</p>

<p>
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and
have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
</p>

<p>
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher
"training" - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge,
even less real content knowledge. That  will keep them in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
They're wrong.
</p>

<p>
People fearing an exodus of prepared CS teachers don't get
education. True, many young CS teachers will leave the profession but
that's because <b><b>many young teachers leave the profession</b></b>. Why do young
teachers leave? Regardless of subject area some of the reasons are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's much harder than everyone thinks it is
</li>
<li>Low pay
</li>
<li>Lack of respect
</li>
<li>Overworked
</li>
<li>Lack of autonomy
</li>
<li>Being scapegoated for poverty
</li>
<li>It's become about testing, not teaching
</li>
</ul>
<p>
None of these are unique to computer science teachers so the argument
that CS teachers who know too much will leave is really saying, "we
have to keep our teachers dumb enough to stay - make sure they don't
have outside options" rather than "let's make teaching a desirable
profession to be in."  
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is bred from a lack of understanding about what drives
teachers. It's typical of politicians and business leaders and short
term temps like TFAers who came in for a cup of coffee and now know
how to solve the education problem.
</p>

<p>
Teacher don't become teachers to
get rich or to do better than the other guy – I know I didn't. We
enter it to do good - to uplift the have nots. This is why business
models like stack ranking and bonus or merit pay just don't work. A
school is a team and we're all in it together. Our job is to take care
of our kids, not to be better than that other guy. We wish we had more
time to work together and to improve things for our entire population.
</p>

<p>
Back to computer science.
</p>

<p>
My contention is that you might lose some teachers to industry but
they either weren't meant to be teachers anyway or they couldn't
afford to be teachers or the system beat them down. None of these are
reasons not to properly prepare them. Besides, all teachers in all
subject areas could work their way into an entry level tech job via a
summer coding boot camp.
</p>

<p>
We can also look to the past to allay concerns. While it's true that
for hiring purposes, English teachers are a dime a dozen and
candidates typically
have fewer outside options (although great English teachers are harder
to find), Math and Science teachers generally have options. I know
many top Math and Science teachers who could easily get non teaching
jobs - the Math teachers in finance the science, certainly in
pharmaceutical companies over in NJ. These options exist yet we manage
to populate our classes with teachers. True, it's difficult at times,
particularly in Physics, but these are due to the lack of respect
teaching gets as a profession.
</p>

<p>
If we prepare CS teachers properly, yes, we'll lose some, but we'll
keep the ones we're supposed to or if we lose them it will be due to
other factors. Additionally, by having proper CS teacher
preparation programs, we'll also provide an entry path to those people
meant to be teachers but prior had no way of getting in.
</p>

<p>
As a nation, we're moving away from prepared, knowledgeable teachers
and towards drill-masters. Let's not let CS Education go the way of
all ed.

In <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-29%2520elfeed/">part 1</a>, I talked about <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>, a really awesome feed reader for
emacs. Generally, I'm really liking it but there's been one problem -
not being able to navigate quickly between groups of feeds with a
keystroke or two.
</p>

<p>
It's emacs so there has to be a solution.
</p>

<p>
Enter <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">hydra</a> - a terrific emacs package from the same guy who brought
us <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">swiper</a>, another one of my favorite emacs packages.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Hydra allows us to create Hydras - a collection of emacs
commands tied o a single prefix along with a nice interface and help
system.
</p>

<p>
Truth be told, I don't use hydra as much anymore since <a href="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key">which-key</a>
does such a great job most of the time. Which-key, however, is no help
here.

Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hydra</a> home page for detailed information.
</p>

<p>
With Hydra installed, I can creat one for navigating in elfeed:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">defhydra</span> <span class="nv">mz/hydra-elfeed</span> <span class="p">()</span>

   <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
and add a binding to the elfeed key map:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">elfeed</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>

	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"q"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">bjm/elfeed-save-db-and-bury</span><span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Q"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">bjm/elfeed-save-db-and-bury</span><span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"m"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">elfeed-toggle-star</span><span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"M"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">elfeed-toggle-star</span><span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"j"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">mz/hydra-elfeed/body</span><span class="p">)</span>
	      <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"J"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">mz/hydra-elfeed/body</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This isn't the actual Hydra I use – we'll get to that in the next
installment where I'll show how to make a Hydra on the fly that
contains keys for all your elfeed tags but this is a reasonable example.

Since the demise of Google Reader, I've been using <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> to read my
streams. Feedly's a nice product and it's been working well for me for
quite some time. 
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, I decided to see what emacs had to offer on the feed
reader front. One solution was Gnus but then I've never been able to
get my head around Gnus. Another was <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd give elfeed a go. 
</p>

<p>
Combined with elfeed-goodies and elfeed-org it's a pretty nice
solution. You can easily search by either keywords or tags and tags
are particularly easy to set up with elfeed-org. 
</p>

<p>
If I want to display all the items from the last month, I hit <b><b>s</b></b> (for
search) and enter the query:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago
</pre></div>

<p>
For only unread posts:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago +unread
</pre></div>

<p>
For unread posts tagged emacs:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@6-months-ago +unread +emacs
</pre></div>

<p>
And for everything in the past 24 hours, read or not:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@1-day-ago
</pre></div>

<p>
It's pretty easy and pretty slick. The only thing missing is easy
single key navigation. There's one solution to that problem over at
<a href="http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/read-your-rss-feeds-in-emacs-with-elfeed/">Pragmatic Emacs</a> and I'll present another one in the next two posts.
</p>

<p>
I'm using some of the code from pragmatic emacs (the functions that start
with <b><b>bjm</b></b>) which makes things easier when sharing the elfeed
database on Dropbox (see the Pragmatic Emacs post above for details) and also a couple of routines I found via web
search). 
</p>

<p>
Here's my basic configuration:

I've been planning to put together a response to <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a>'s
recent post - <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/02/software-developersquantity-vs-quality.html">Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality</a>. 
</p>

<p>
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read
Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most
people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not
at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent
in America? Does it even matter?
</p>

<p>
Before getting to "does it matter," I looked over at the Kaggle
leaderboards. Looking at their top 10, 2 were from the US - no other
country had more than 1. The 11th placing competitor was also from the
US and then 12 was from China, giving them 2 in the top 12.  I also
looked at recent <a href="http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=total_desc">IOI results</a> and a quick glance seems to indicate that
the USA seems to do reasonably well. In short, if you buy into ranking
a country by these types of individual results on specific
competitions then we're doing fine.
</p>

<p>
But, does filling the leaderboard mean a country's producing the best
tech talent? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
Coding competitions focus on a specific skill set. There are problem
solving aspects but they also require speed, knowledge of data
structures and algorithms, and, yes, even accurate, fast typing
skills. They also require you work alone. They don't encourage well
designed, architected, or written code, working on existing code bases
or working with a team. 
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I've known some very smart and talented individuals
who've excelled at these types of competitions. If you extend the pool
to math and science competitions, I've known quite a few. These
individuals have by and large done well for themselves but as a group,
you couldn't call them more successful than any other subset of my
former students. A number of them have gone on and are doing well as
professors or programmers but, by and large, they're not the ones
who've gone on to found companies and provide jobs for scores or even
hundreds of other people and they're not necessarily the ones who've
led teams that have developed major platforms and projects<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="posts/quality-devs-and-coding-contests/#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
I don't argue that people who populate competition leaderboards are
talented and a necessary part of our tech ecosystem but they're only a
part. I probably want one of these programmers on my team, but not as
the entire team (see Fake Grimlock's laws of startups - <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/secret-laws-startups-part-2-build-right-team">law 9</a>).

Competitive programming is a piece of the puzzle as competitive
programmers are a part of the population. So are project based events
like <a href="https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/">Dream it. Code it. Win it.</a>, science fairs, and hackathons, which
can be either cooperative, competitive, or a combination.
</p>

<p>
What do we want? Balance. I think the Stuy program does it pretty
well. StuyCS graduates who wish to take part in coding competitions
can do so but if they want to excel at it, they have to work at it on
their own time. At the same time, the students learn how to work in
teams and take a project from idea to delivery all the while learning
some good academic CS and software engineering practices. They'll
learn more in college on the academic side and the rest on the
job. I'd love to see better balance in the colleges between CS
programs preparing kids for graduate programs and CS programs that
prepare kids for industry. I'd also love to see CS minors that were
more targeted towards CS+X rather than half of a CS major targeting
students going to grad schools. 
</p>

<p>
I also think there's a tremendous opportunity for community colleges
to fill the role currently occupied by code schools. They could more
easily strike a balance between academic depth and practical
preparation.
</p>

<p>
I'm working on building Hunter College's honors CS program and while I
can't move the Hunter curriculum, I'm seeking that balance in my own
way.
</p>

<p>
Will we get there? I don't know. Given the way education works, I
figure at some point people will decide that we have to have more of a
presence on the CS leaderboards and we'll see programs pop up with
that in mind. I have no doubt that when that happens, we'll see many
more Americans near the top. We have a large enough population that
talent shouldn't be in question. This will be great for students to
whom these competitions attract. It won't do much, however for the
rest of the students. I'm not really concerned one way or
another. Unlike math, where there's a natural progression through K12
math classes with math team and math competitions being a natural add
on, the driving forces in CS - be they from industry, government, or
academia don't seem to have partaken in any code competition Kool-Aid
so code competitions won't become a driving force in CS ed any time
soon.

Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy's intro CS course. Like
any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce
students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a
first language and why despite that,  I don't recommend it in many
cases.
</p>

<p>
Scheme certainly isn't mainstream. That's not the main reason why I
like it but it is a side benefit. It's less likely kids come into
class knowing it which creates a level playing field. The few times
I've had a student with a background in Scheme, they've been good,
helpful kids rather than ones that tried to show off and dominate the
class. 
</p>

<p>
I like scheme because it's simple. It looks different than other
languages but is <code>(+ 3 4)</code> really that different than <code>add(3,4)</code> or
<code>3+4</code>? 
</p>

<p>
We can tell kids "everything's a function." While technically not
true, and I tell my students that it isn't, it's close enough for our
purposes. Everything's a function and the way we write a function is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">f</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Apply function <b><b>f</b></b> on arguments <b><b>b c …</b></b>. So we have <code>(+ 2 3)</code> to
add 2 and 3, <code>(and a b)</code> for logical and <code>(= 3 4)</code> to test to see if 3
is equal to 4, etc. We also have the same basic notation for things
like conditionals. In java, we might write:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In scheme, it would be:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">&gt; </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="mi">5</span>
  <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Even though we're fudging the rules, we can lay out a handful of rules
for the kids such as lambda and define follow a similar form to create and
name functions:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="nv">add2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
where <code>(lambda (a b) (+ a b))</code> returns a function that adds <b><b>a</b></b> and
<b><b>b</b></b> and <code>define</code> associates it with the identifier <b><b>add2</b></b>. Now we
can use the function: <code>(add2 5 10)</code> which evaluates to 15.
</p>

<p>
With lambda, define, if, and a few more basics, it's off to the
races. The simple, consistent syntax makes things easy for the kids
and the constrained tool set lets us focus their way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
Of course this wouldn't work had DrScheme (now <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>) not
existed. That gave us a nice learning IDE to work in.
</p>

<p>
Using Scheme, we can not only cover the basics like conditionals,
abstraction and such but also deeper concepts like recursion, map,
filter, and reduce. When we move on from Scheme, the kids also have a
frame of reference for all the other languages and paradigms they use.
</p>

<p>
There are downsides, however. Outside help is harder to come by and
there is some pushback from parents and it isn't as pretty and flashy
as some other tool-sets. Scheme worked at Stuy for a number of
reasons. When I created the class that used it, there were no good
pre-AP classes in the school and I had a pretty good reputation as a
teacher. The class also used multiple tools with <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> being the
primary other one and tackled a variety of CS and non CS topics.
First time through, reputation and buzz filled the classes and after
that, the class developed a solid enough reputation to fill itself.
</p>

<p>
It also didn't hurt that our program developed from the inside
out. First, we had APCS-AB on the books as a junior year course, then
I added our post AP senior year electives. Since it was easy to show
what the kids were already graduating with, it was easy to diffuse any
pushback from not using mainstream tools in the first class.
</p>

<p>
Scheme worked at Stuy and I feel that it still does. Would I use
Scheme for a first experience in a drop in program at an after-school
where kids might not come back if they don't get to a payoff
immediately? Probably not. Would I recommend it at a school where I
want to integrate CS with some of the other subjects quickly, again,
probably not (except for integration with algebra where <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrapworld</a>
is a terrific program).
</p>

<p>
In any event, if you're a high school CS teacher and  haven't played
with scheme  or some other functional language, I highly recommend
it - you might not actually ever teach it or use it but it can really
help develop you as a programmer and an educator.

I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they
mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice
of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly
in the form of "why don't you start them with Javascript?" 
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme,
NetLogo and then later Python, I'd get similar pushback but then it
was "why not Java?", "why not C?", or "whu not C++?"
</p>

<p>
We had a good discussion on this and I shared my thoughts as to why I
don't like Javascript as a first language and I thought I'd share some
of them here. I'll try to get around to the rationale behind Scheme
and NetLogo in a later post.
</p>

<p>
To start, let me say that I <b><b>Love</b></b> Javascript -
particularly when approaching it as a functional language. I also
think every school and situation is different so there are likely
times when Javascript is the right beginner language for the job.
</p>

<p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>
Why are some of the pluses for Javascript as an intro language.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ubiquity and availability:

<p>
If you have a browser, you have Javascript - it's also available
through online IDEs and online lightweight sites like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Interactivity:

<p>
You can tweak websites almost live, use the HTML5 canvas pretty
interactively and mode
</p>
</li>

<li>It's mainstream
</li>

<li>It's quick to get up and running
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is all true, but there are also downsides.
</p>

<p>
One of my big problems with Javascript is the lack of simple solid
educational tooling. I love to use tools like <a href="http://www.drjava.org/">DrJava</a>, <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a>, and
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> (formerly DrScheme) with beginners. All simple learning
IDEs. True, you can use a simple online IDE but I haven't found them
to have as strong a learning interface. They also, generally, keep you
in an oversimplified programming sandbox. There's no clean transition
from the sandbox to the real deal - particularly given the non-trivial
state of js build tools and environments. These simple learning IDEs
set the stage and then we can transition to more powerful development environments.
</p>

<p>
I also prefer, where possible, to have kids learn locally so that they
can learn something about the underlying operating system even if
only at a user level.
</p>

<p>
A problem relating to the lack of tooling is the fact that a JS
program can fail to run and not give you any meaningful feedback at
all - this is a problem for a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also has all sorts of wonkiness. We have <code>=</code>, and <code>==</code>
which is pretty conventional, but then there's also <code>===</code>. We have
potentially confusing scoping issues and also some other real
weirdness:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">53</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//  50</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'53'</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// '533</span>

</pre></div>

it's a riot.
</p>

<p>
All of this weirdness actually makes sense - just not to a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
Javascript also gives plenty of freedom - there are many ways to do
things. This can be great for the developer but not necessarily ideal
for the learner. Loops, recursion, mapping functions - you name it,
Javascript's got it. I like simpler languages for beginners because
it's easier to get them thinking and problem solving in certain ways
when there tool set is somewhat restricted (more on that when I write
about Scheme).
</p>

<p>
Finally, the fact that Javascript's a mainstream language can be a
minus. Given its popularity, a beginner class could have at  least a
few kid who've at least played with the language. This can lead them
to think they know more than they do and more importantly, this can
be intimidating to the real newbies who develop the impression that
"everyone knows this but me." A less mainstream language puts everyone
on a level playing field.
</p>

<p>
Let me say again that I love javascript as a language and before a
student graduates Stuy they can learn all about Javascript, front end
development, some functional programming, and more. It's just not the
right language to start with - at least not at Stuy.
